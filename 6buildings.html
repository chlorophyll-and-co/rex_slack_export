This will be my all purpose building.  I am shooting for 36ft x 48ft x14ft at the eves.  It will eventually have a concrete floor and we will be catching the rain water to help fill a pond.  I hope to put about 6KW of panels on it.  We have a lot of cloudy days here so the output won't be the best, but it should be better than wind in my area.  Plus solar is easier to add on panels as necessary.  The building will store hay and equipment plus be winter shelter for some cows.  I am hoping to have 6 steers by winter but my timeline keeps sliding.  Eventually I would like to add on a heated shop.  For now though I need to get my equipment out of the weather.</div></div></div><br/>

I would agree that standing seam seems better.  However, on the house the cost was double compared to exposed fastener and the warranty was the same.  (50year metal, 40 year on the fasteners prices were $6,200  and $11,500)  At that rate I can buy a lot of panels.  Plus I have less to risk on the barn than on the house.  The wiring will cost more but I can buy through my business at significant discount.  Any suggestions on mounting systems for exposed fastener versions?  Thoughts on types of panels.  The micro inverter version seems to make more sense.  I am thinking of a 6/12 pitch.  It seem to be the best balance between seasons.  Also, I live in the snow belt are there issues with snow build up.  What should I be thinking in terms of load on the trusses?  It is very possible for us to see 2ft in one storm.  In the last 10 years we had at 1.5ft in one storm at least 5 times.  I am betting that storms are getting stronger leading to more extremes.</div></div></div><br/>

But what predators do you have? I'd say without a night coop or other covered/sealed-in enclosure, brace yourself for heavy losses from night predators. That may change if you have a couple of good guardian dogs (raised with the chickens) - indeed @ and others very likely know more about this. Shade will definitely be an issue in the higher range of those temps. We were raising cornish x meat birds on pasture and in the low to mid-30s they started to keel over (late May to mid September in Okanagan, BC). Free access to water *that they don't have to walk far to get to* and far = less than about 5 m. We had a setup of mobile nipples and automatic waterers (small refilling bowls) hooked to a hose, which kept the water from getting too hot or mucky in hot weather, and flowing frequently enough to keep it from heating up in the hose.</div></div></div><br/>

We'll give it a go and see. Temp° is more of  a potential issue, I plan to have a july/aug break on the pasture, water will be coming from a nipple line under the trees supplied by a shaded watercan up in the trees. These are small properties (5,7,10 ha) and starting fence cells will be around 150 m2 with a 100  chickens over 2 tree rows (olives or citrus with low crowns and ample shade) we'll start with cornishX that we'll quickly mix with the local 'beldi' chicken. Will let you know how that goes. thanks Susan, you're a star, your inputand presence is amazing on all fronts  webinars/slack.</div></div></div><br/>

I think that elevation drawings (to scale) with shading diagrams might be helpful in this instance. Just as it would be useful in the case of @ query around Keyline patterns and shading too.</div></div></div><br/>
