I wonder how do you facilitate busy people to dive into these kind of things? It's not going to be a problem for the people living here but i have a challenge to facilitate others who don't live here and are a crucial part of this project, especially owners (not part of REX). They are extremely busy people and can't afford to be active participants. It's a challenge in general to find the time and communicate with them for the past 3 years. I want them to WANT to dive into this, take their time and to be aware how important it is but I really don't know how to communicate this. It seems strange to just send them questions via email. I could talk to them on phone and make myself clear somehow before i send them the questions. Thanks for your feedback and guidance.</div></div></div><br/>

For me/us, it was an opportunity that presented itself -- they were all getting together for a "team meeting" and made the time. I gave them materials a week ahead to review but of course, they didn't -- in hindsight, a "pre-work" document may have helped. Talking on the phone first may help, but it may be something they come to slowly. I would be prepared to go through the process yourselves as on-site managers, and develop your own holistic context and goals, demonstrating to yourselves first and then others how useful it is, before expending a lot of energy to get others on board to a process you are yourselves just starting with.</div></div></div><br/>

What I am so excited about with HM decision making is that it embraces change, both the human capacity to change and our change in circumstances- by updating it regularly- you are ensuring the decisions you are making towards your Holistic Context reflect who you are, where your business is at right now... the result is a relevant, dynamic  &amp; nimble person  and or business - with a clarity- giving you the ability to sift the 'noise'  Check out Who Moved my cheese  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16hxCB1Dvd4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16hxCB1Dvd4</a></div></div></div><br/>

There is no community. The typical neighbor is over-leveraged, lives beyond their means, and constantly votes for more stupid government spending that only increases property taxes even more. HOAs greatly restrict what one can do with properties. Yet this is reasonable compared to some of my colleagues in New York City who are life long renters with no savings despite making even more than I do.</div></div></div><br/>

Loudoun has decent schools and does a better than average job with gifted kids. My oldest daughter is starting 9th grade this fall. She is already on an engineering track, is several years ahead of the normal math track (took Algebra 2 in 8th grade and will take BC Calculus in 10th and will get past differential equations before she graduates from high school. My youngest starts 6th grade and is also in the gifted program but probably not quite as hard core engineering focused as her sister. I cannot sell the home in Leesburg for 7 more years. The school systems where there is economically viable farmland have pathetic school systems with no calculus and no AP or dual enrollment classes.</div></div></div><br/>

Perhaps like others, I feel like I've answered some of those holistic questions in an intuitive, internal sense over the years ( I mean, we've all come to working with the land for a reason, right?) but not explicitly stated them or written them down. It will be challenging to articulate all that and document it but I'll give my best shot! :slightly_smiling_face:</div></div></div><br/>

We know what we know, but there's always a lot more than we don't. Being confident in yourself and your knowledge is one thing, but approaching educational situations with the assumption you are wrong, or to put it less negatively - don't know everything, allows you open ears and open learning. - Isaebella</div></div></div><br/>

This is not what I had in mind when signing up but can see the value and appreciate its inclusion. I noticed a couple of people have offered to assist with our holistic contexts. This is great and would genuinely like to take that up. However I do feel some of this stuff (in the original questionnaire at least) is a bit personal and while happy to share with someone who's directly able to assist don't really want to open it all up to the whole group with this stuff. At least not without a little refinement. Is there a way of accessing the assistance (if quotas aren't already filled and still happy to do so with this limitation) whilst maintaining some discretion?</div></div></div><br/>

Ideas, decisions and actions need to be proven right for our context through testing before being acted upon. Assuming we are always right when we have a new idea leads to many of the ?Cognitive Bias? traps that result in poor decisions that tend to take us away from, rather than toward, the quality of life that we seek. Assuming ourselves wrong puts us in the position of being more rigorous in our decision making processes.</div></div></div><br/>

I had overlooked Holistic Management on two critical occasions much to my regret. I spoke of these recently during an interview with @mattpowers on his podcast. 

The first was in 1994 when at a St. Arnaud backyard BBQ I sparred with a recent HM course graduate just a few months after I'd done my first PDC. You know the drill, 'my method is better than your method..."

The 2nd was a year later when following my 2nd PDC, this time with the late Bill Mollison, I was in Bill's extensive library and while Bill was beside me I pulled out a copy of 'Holistic Resource Management' (1st ed. 1988), and he said, '...put that back? that stuff is destroying Africa..."

It wasn't until 2006 that I picked up HM again and have done what I can to make up for all of that time I lost ever since...

The last 5+ years I've battled chronic energy depletion -- which is not nearly the magnitude of the Lyme battle, but I hear you on not being able to say "I am full of energy and vitality." What about "I maintain a positive and proactive attitude about the energy I have available", "My health is improving and I find joy in every day"... these are things you CAN control. You can't control whether you are full of energy and vitality (and none of us can) -- the harder and more important work is recognizing what to do and how we treat ourselves in the &lt;100% days -- and more, in the -10% days. Serious, ongoing depression (cyclic &amp; untreatable with medication) taught me that learning to work with what I *could* do got me a lot further than trying to be in a mental place that on some days, I just couldn't access. Hope that helps.  (Does it?)</div></div></div><br/>

East Wind Defined: East Wind is a community owned and operated by the members, who share all income and expenses, rear their children communally, and are communally responsible for all the needs of the community?s members, including food, clothing, shelter, medical care, education, and other needs and amenities considered desirable, insofar as the community is able to provide them.                                                           ~Bylaws Ratified 1978~

East Wind Purpose:

We are creating a society which offers its members no less than they need, which asks from its members no more than they can give, and which promotes the greatest good for all the people.

We are creating a society where positions of responsibility are not positions of exploitation and in which we do not promote inequality through discrimination on the grounds of race, creed, age, or sex. [Amended in 1980 to append the phrase ?or sexual preference ?.]

We are creating a society which is non-violent and non-competitive, where people mutually respect and tolerate individual differences of belief, opinions, and taste, and where personal possessiveness is not supported.

We are building a society that responsibly maintains all natural resources for itself, future generations, and for all people through an ecologically sound lifestyle.

We are striving to be self-reliant, especially in cooperation with similar groups.

To the greatest extent possible, the trade in which we engage will promote and contribute to the growth and maintenance of a non-exploitative world economy.

We are perpetuating our community in such a way that it will be available to succeeding generations.

We are growing and will maintain a membership of at least 750 members, as rapidly as is consistent with our survival. {Sumner?s note for web viewers: this line was written many decades ago by the very optimistic and ambitious founders of East Wind, currently there is legislation in place limiting the number of members at East Wind to 73 and we seek to grow in a practical and ecologically responsible manner}

We are creating a society benefiting its members but also serving as an example of social organization applicable to the rest of the world.

We are publicizing this lifestyle in order to serve as an example of social organization applicable to the rest of the world, and we promote the formation and growth of similar communities.

Paragraph 3.

The definition and purposes listed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article shall be implemented by:

The use of experimentation to discover and encourage the desirable behaviors for the group?s members and its government.

A system of internal economics that, so far as is feasible, makes material benefits of the community available to all members equally or according to need.

A general practice respecting the liberty of each individual member to as great an extent as is consistent with the well-being of the community and the laws of the government in whose jurisdiction it resides.

An emphasis on promoting cooperation rather than competition among the members.

A dedication to a non-violent, non-exploitative way of life for all human beings, and specifically an insistence on non-involvement of members in actions contrary to this policy.

Paragraph 4.

In no event shall the resources or facilities of this community be used to further in any manner any project, activity, or purpose of any group or individual that is inconsistent with the purposes of this community as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and these Bylaws.

" East Wind bylaws Ratified 1978"</div></div></div><br/>

1. Define your whole. 
  a. Decision makers
  b. 8 forms of capital (be sure to include your income sources with your financial capital piece. Highlighting the sources of income over just ?money in the bank? was one of the primary reasons Savory differentiated Money and Resource Base in his original work)

2. Define what wealth means to you

3. Define you weakest link (it might be helpful to note that, within the Holistic Management framework there are 3 links in the ?Chain of Production?. So, when Javan asks us to identify the ?weakest link? I assume he is referring to one of these three links in the chain of production ? although I don?t recall him explicitly naming or describing the three links - they, nevertheless, are as follows:
Resource Conversion - Product Conversion - and Marketing (or Money Conversion)
Resource Conversion deals with converting resources into products i.e. sunlight into grass.
Product Conversion deals with converting the resources into a marketable product i.e. grass into beef.
The Market link deals with converting the product into money i.e. you?ve got plenty of beef but no one is buying it.
You can only have ONE weakest link in the chain of production and that is the link you need to focus the bulk of your energy and investment on.)

4. Define your highest want for your project. (This can be done through the Holistic Management Framework as follows:
Quality of Life Statement = What you want
Forms of Production = What you need to do (behaviors)
Future Resource Base = How you know if it?s true (7 generations, monitoring and indicators).

5. Write a Daily Statement of Purpose and test drive it.

Hope this recap is helpful for everyone! Cheers and have a great week!</div></div></div><br/>

We are very excited for this aspect of the course but having a bit of difficulty when it comes to the 8 forms of capital. I did look into the appleseed permaculture reference for further help but I am still struggling with how to answer some of these. Is it possible that we do not have all the forms of capital? Is that common, or perhaps am I just not looking in the correct direction. Here are the forms I am currently struggling with: Spiritual-we do not follow any specific religion we simply do as we would want others to do unto us. Is that my answer? Cultural- because we moved to a new region of the state we do not have history or community around us that we know of yet. And although we have family whom which we are very connected to they are 400+ miles from here. Am I heading in the correct direction on this form of capital or did I miss the point? Experiential- I am completely lost on this form. Social- I suppose the only influence we have is with our extended family as those are whom we communicate regularly with, is that a correct assumption? Hope that was clear enough and that I am not too far off. Any assistance is greatly appreciated, thank you!! </div></div></div><br/>

Spiritual Capital - yes, that is your answer. The Golden Rule as some call it.

Cultural Capital - This one is deficient in many who live in western culture. I usually relate culture to the ways in which we go about obtaining, preparing and sharing our meals. What is the culture around that for you currently?

Experiential - Think of this one as your Skill Set. What skills do you have?

Social - I think about this one in terms of skills you might be able to leverage from your social network. Is there someone you call on when you are having a technical issue with a computer or a health issue with a farm animal who might work for something other than a financial exchange?</div></div></div><br/>

I personally find it is very closely tied to cultural capital.  Many people have Trouble with these two forms in particular because of the impact of consumerism and the individual approach to life that's been patterned into our way of thinking and seeing the world.   The importance for this exercise is to ask: what brings our family meaning?   How do we cultivate the conditions where that meaning is the fruit of our actions?
Culture can be though of as culinary tradition and story, songs and art: that which connects us back to the story we are choosing to live through our life design.   It may be as simple as the culture of giving thanks for a meal.</div></div></div><br/>

I strongly believe in the capacity of culture to evolve.  I also personally believe in enquiring into the deeper roots before adopting something new.   However those are my personal guidelines and what is important is you answering for yourself and being clear with yourself in developing this holistic context what te cultural capital is you have available and what you will need to be enmeshed within to be living the world of your goal.   This forms the framework to guide decisions beyond this moment when the going gets tough and you might forget the deeper reasons why....
@kyliewilson So to answer directly: I would tend to make note of that which you have, as well as be courageous in exploring that which you believe will be needed as the cultural soil to sustain your vision.   Then you can truly see what and where you need to grow.  </div></div></div><br/>

You'll be able to go through that document you have and prune and shape it into the pieces to fit within the holistic context.  

The reason you'll want it to be shorter will become clear as it did for me. When you start using the testing questions it will take a LONG time to go through each question for each thing you have to test.  In order for this to be an effective tool you want to be able to use it efficiently.  When I first started and had to take an hour to go through the decision making matrix it was challenging at best and sometimes quite innefective as i'd lose my ability to stay present with it by the end.

I'd recommend making this a tool that is going to be effective for you to use on a daily basis.</div></div></div><br/>

The explicit nature of this in the process helps keep the distinction between POTENTIAL and POSSIBILITY.  Here I am speaking through our own process lens, and not explicitly the holistic goal and context process as Javen presented, however I believe them to be coherent.  The difference between POTENTIAL and PROCESS is important to discern.  Potential is unique and only comes from a concrete circumstance.  Think of the potential energy of a boulder perched on a hill, or of water in storage high in a landscape.  These have potential.  You must take steps to unlock that potential.  Possibilities are abstractions ungrounded in concrete context, but are very attractive to our minds, service to distract from design imperatives and parameters that will arise from this deeper grounding in context forming the liberating structure of a regenerative agriculture and life design.</div></div></div><br/>

So, yes, I imagine that is fine. I?d defer to @regrarians for confirmation on this but I think that, for the purpose of this training, doing what makes the most sense for you and your project is what is most important. To get the most out of this training you?ll want to shape your work and your output to your needs. If it is helpful to do that in the format of the RP checklist, than yes, do that. If it would be more helpful to have it separated into it?s own document or put into a different format (a mindmap or some other way of displaying and navigating the information) than do that. 
Remember, we want this training to propel you toward success more than anything. This output work that you are doing now is best tuned for longterm use for you and the other people involved in your project. Guidance documents, if you will. The more focused they are on that longterm perspective the more valuable this training will likely be for you.</div></div></div><br/>

Not all kids are the same of course however I've found children to be highly adaptable. 

The other question is how much of what we want out of our adult lives revolves around the 'choices' we give to our children ? what I mean by that is that sometimes we parents hold ourselves back from doing what we want to do so that we can give our children 'the best opportunities'. I think of people like @hollyburton and their experiences with their kids and indeed our own in this regard.</div></div></div><br/>

Until very recently the goverment wouldn't even allow aminals from culling programs to be used in petfood! It's just crazy and wasteful. Maybe one day it will change. We have large deer problems where we are - they were quite rare when i was growing up but especially since the fires populations have exploded.  Would just love to be able to harvest them and provide this fantastic wild resource to conscious consumers! </div></div></div><br/>

"Giving the kids the best opportunities" was my biggest pain point when we started this journey 2 years ago. I have now come to see the value in looking at the world through a different lense and see that the things that are really deeply important to me are not provided by the opportunities i was feeling like they might be loosing anyway..

As I've been working with the 8 Forms of Capital understanding that there are currencies helps to know what to inventory. Checking into this image produced by @landua and Ethan Roland <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By_OULtaAGV8UElYdHdRcElRbFU">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By_OULtaAGV8UElYdHdRcElRbFU</a> you'll find that each capital has a CURRENCY. I use these CURRENCIES to better understand a context for a whole. Currently what are the stories, beliefs and narratives within the whole you manage? Further what are the communities and connections that they "complex to" (Roland and Landua's wording). The second level of the narratives and stories you hold is if you are the protagonist or antagonist within these stories. For the elements you described from other farming families it's useful, in my experience, to know what you're working with.</div></div></div><br/>

Spiritual, what guides you and motivates you? For some it's dogma and deities for others a sense of "do no harm", "leave things better then I found it" for others still it's "work within the flows and cycles of nature". This is closer to your motivation. As @landua stated, many in a consumer society that have been desensitized to where their internal compass point have a hard time tapping into why they do what they do. Once you've come to a sense of why that is, ask "Why?". Asking a chained why (5-7 whys) of every answer can help you find the bottom of what's true for the decision makers in your whole. Culturla capital are the stories, narratives, rites and rituals you hold as a whole. You have beliefs and stories about farming, food, GMO, what is means to do work. All of these are stories that inform the work. As Gregory pointed out if you give thanks before a meal, this too is a rite or ritual. You can also consider what are the stories and narratives of the land as it's part of your whole. What exists here? What are the conversations? Experiential - What has each decision makers have the experience of? What's the embedded experience of those who are within the whole? Social, who are the people the decision makers know and what capitals or assets can be accessed through them? Hope that helps.</div></div></div><br/>

Nothing lost cos all the revisions are there in google but just wanted to apologise. I am now just about to go and try to make the most recent version your version so you can ignore the middle revisions which are me. I will transfer these into my folder now.

With the business I co-founded, Propagate Ventures, we work purely within the monetary economy, because what we?re doing is building financial vehicles to diversify working farms with tree crops. We don?t chase carbon payments, because they lie outside of what economics and finance govern: ecosystem services are public goods, which is economics jargon for ?people don?t instinctively want to pay for them.? Every time carbon credits came to the table, I reminded my partners that we don?t deal with carbon credits. We create systems that inherently sequester carbon, but we don?t chase with payments for ecosystem services. Sticking to a purely financial model has allowed us to stay much more focused.</div></div></div><br/>

Some are likely warded off by all the busyness of slack and just want a trimmed down, easy to access version of only the most important and relevant info.

I wonder if for #REX10WK2 if we might drop the rex.farm/lesson comments bar altogether. As I mentioned before we're going to close the registrations for the next REX 7 days out from the start so that we can have some really solid orientation beforehand so that when we kick off with the program we're all in the zone and not wondering how to drive. 

Furthermore we'll also look to test the new Facebook-based 'Workplace' app as a (free) alternative to Slack too.</div></div></div><br/>

I went through Helen Lewis' questionnaire for my business, A Local Larder - I cook and teach cooking, and more to farmers and home cooks, so I am on the Chef's side of agriculture.  My work begins where the Farmer and Rancher's work ends.  I'm here and available to discuss anything food related from menus, recipes and nutrition, to preservation, fermentation, slaughter, butchery, value added products for farmers, food hubs and food sheds in general.  Here is the link, below,  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AFaJ9whelODTrMdmaBtdkczHuzahgKQb6G-yNCPexg8/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AFaJ9whelODTrMdmaBtdkczHuzahgKQb6G-yNCPexg8/edit</a>        I thought, since it addresses food, and a food business, it might be of interest to some of you.</div></div></div><br/>

Obviously the people around us are part of the 'climate' layer - pretty hard to change. I know we need to be more proactive about getting out and about and meeting people but what happens if we're still not feeling like we're making real friends and building community in another year or two?

I re-watched and took pretty good notes. Not all of the stories.  I have been doing this holistic context work for about six months now, initially with @jkbernak, and only now am I beginning to really see how the whole system actually fits together to make a real difference on the ground.  This is easily the best introduction to this subject I have gotten, so great work.  And the work participants have submitted is also really good, reading them has been extremely educational, dozens of case studies, if you will.

I am a minority (~11%) owner of the NY projects, am on their board, and also have a quite sizeable contract fabricating components for the facilities and managing the construction.

Likewise, commercial scale mushroom growing using bag systems is insanely profitable. So are controlled environment greenhouses (as long as you have access to capital and offtake agreements with grocers). Grazing cattle is one of the lowest ROI land uses but even that can be very profitable if you operate your own processing and sell direct to end-users as Joel Salatin does.</div></div></div><br/>

To increase value, you need to increase the net operating profit. The Bastian property has enormous potential because it literally could support multiple enterprises. The timber alone offers the potential to generate 5X to 8X the current value of the property. Mushrooms can scale with relatively little space while also enhancing soils. Greenhouses also serve as nurseries. By then, things like grazing only have to pay for themselves not pay for the property (but even grazing can be leveraged through the use of leased land Greg Judy style).  Forest and stream areas can be developed for Agrotourism. Trees can eventually yield fruit and nuts in volume.</div></div></div><br/>

Ultimately, you need to have something in common to become friends and both parties have to make an effort. I'm in the phase of life (married with daughters in 9th and 6th grade) where I find it is very hard to make or keep friendships because everyone is too busy with work, family obligations, driving kids to activities, chores, travel, et cetera. Likewise, friends from high school and college are now spread throughout the country and even the world, adding additional layers of physical distance and time zones.

There are some enterprises (e.g. poultry) that have a decent ROI on a small scale but have very low ROIs in larger scales while for others, the numbers do not work until you reach a minimum scale of operation and then increase as you get larger and larger. This is particularly true for grazing businesses - depending on your climate most of the numbers I have seen need 100 head as the minimum scale but you need 1000 head / 2000-3000+ acres to really be competitive. For some of the commodity crops (wheat; corn; etc) you need 1000 acres to afford a combine and more to really be really viable.</div></div></div><br/>

Good wishes </div></div></div><br/>

Cool. And I like very much the possibility to not only design an enterprise, but my life with it. So, I sat down and looked at my holistic context, and came up with this one here: 
Destiny Statement of Purpose:
I deepen my understanding of the natural world and produce healthy food in harmony within it. I develop resilient solutions in ecological, economic and societal contexts.

Daily Statement of Purpose:
I find an equilibrium between work/education and time for myself (for leisure, health, spirituality, family).

Quality of life statement:
I lead a healthy, fulfilling life, be a loving father, and inspire people (with/through my work in permaculture and other approaches to long-lasting solutions.)

Not sure if this sounds alright... Just some thoughts. Thanks for any feedback... Thanks so much for your work!!</div></div></div><br/>

I have been work with context since my HMI training 4 years ago and have struggled to really implement and practice using the tool of context. Despite having a cheat sheet of testing questions in my jacket pocket. @jkbernak recommendation of setting your DaSop as the lock screen on the phone was so simple but solid advice. 

My weak link has been two fold. 
1) hero or as I like to think the wolf ( pulpfiction reference) always coming in to bail out coworkers from their failings or miss steps. DaSop stolen from @jkbernak "Not my monkeys, not my circus"

2) often above has lead to disorder and poor time
management along with poor scheduling on my part.  So, DaSop "I will be well organized and scheduled"

Keep at it, you did a great job keeping out the metrics and focusing on states.  One more thing.  Something to be aware of is having decisions be part of your statements.  "I sleep outside"  It seems like thats a choice/decision, and the real statement there is that you have a connection to nature/the outdoors, something you expressed in other places.  Take a look and see where you might have more of these types of choices embedded and consider how they may tie into things you've already shared, or how they point to bigger ideas of ways of being.</div></div></div><br/>

Only those that survive you know with any relative understanding what your destiny was. My biggest why and daily why during depression was "Make it to the next day". After that it was about "Who am I" these days it's "I live happy, strong and honest" and has been that way for a while. As for the destiny sop I currently don't have one. I'm looking at what the big conversation is in my life and what I think I'm bringing with my efforts. I have hints of it. Sometimes the why is to find the why.</div></div></div><br/>

Dasop, is for you currently. Your HC seems to be for your family. What's your weak link for the whole family and then what's the dasop for the family, if this is the whole? First impressions your HC is huge! Consider pruning judiciously to what's essential. Keep QOL's down to one sentence that captures the essence of what you desire for the future of the whole you're managing. There's a lot of "we are happy... " in the HC. What does that actually mean for you and your decision makers? If the whole is about you and yours, then the abundance of "We" is likely redundant. Consider instead of "We are strong, fit and healthy" "Strong, Fit and Healthy". For the BS for this QOL, consider instead "Exercise", "Nutrient Dense Food", why no "from our garden"? It</div></div></div><br/>

I imagine if you had nutrient dense uncontaminated food you'd be strong, fit and happy, so don't force how it's source. You can have a personal preference but life laughs at plans. My take on your FI's in order: Stamina, Adventures, Vitality, Bright Minds. I find the tigher the HC is the easier it is to use. Consider these points when you're editing your HC. Remember "Edit your life frequently and ruthlessly, it's your masterpiece after all." Nathan W. Morris.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-20 16:22</div><div class="msg">@jkbernak commented on @wilshoyah?s file <a href="https://regrarians.slack.com/files/wilshoyah/F6C6BLES2/Am_I_there_yet">https://regrarians.slack.com/files/wilshoyah/F6C6BLES2/Am_I_there_yet</a>: So many monkeys... first of we're all talking monkeys, hurdling though space on a chuck of cosmic rock. That should land us in the right context. Second there are 4 minds that we can readily consider, the primal mind (crocodile) fight, flight, freeze connected to the vagus nerve;  amygdala (puppy) emotional center; cortex (monkey) rational brain; pre-frontal cortex (porpoise) future considering and higher rationalization. When something crosses a primal aspect of us and engages the puppy brain we "flip our lid" and lose the ability to use the monkey and porpoise. Like many in the REX who reacted to setting their why on paper or being told "here's a way to check your decisions or make better decisions" there was a friction point that rubbed against what cultural capital they held for themselves. "I'm great at decisions" "There's nothing more for me to learn here" "This has nothing to do with land design" All these thoughts are as they are. Not good not bad just are. When we encounter something that doesn't jive with our existing stories (cultural capitals) there's a friction point. This is commonly seen on social media where person x says "I love cheese" and person y says "Cheese makes me ill" and they argue past each other as they're attempting to maintain their world view. Not good nor bad, just is. And so on and on it goes. The monkey mind is the cortex, the rational brain. It's rationalizing away and attempting to make sense of the world. For further reading check out "Your brain at work" it'll change your life if you let it.  Managing the monkey mind has been one of my greatest challenges and one of my greatest acheivements (when it happens). As it always wants to MAKE MEANING. We are "meaning making monkeys" and when something happens in our life we attempt to shoe horn it into our context our sense of the world. The bed of procrustes is the story of inn keeper who would bring travels to their inn, wine and dine them with unimaginable hedonistic pleasure and upon retiring would bring them to a bed that was too short or too big for them and stretch them or cut off parts of their bodies to make them fit. The analogy for life is apt. We constantly attempt to "make things fit" instead of working to "find a good fit". The mind is constantly attempting to create a bed of procrustes for everything we see. What is that? How can I relate it back to what I know? This is the sound of the trash can thundering down a suburban alley way at 3am. When we use an outside framework that we've populated with our sense of how we want to live but not the what of the how, we can ensure we don't force fit or force function life into a box that we don't even really want it to fit into in the first place.</div></div></div><br/>

I take it from your comments that the target should be as lean and direct a document as possible regarding the HC. Remove redundancy and fluff wherever it hides. Is this true? Its easy to slip into expansive language/thought when writing about one's highest hopes. I've been sort of split on whether this is just a document for myself or if this is something I would share with others of our Whole (beyond Primary Decision Makers) as a useful, regular tool. It strikes me as a powerful thing to share within our team, but what I've currently created is really a personal HC.

Not to mention a short fall in experience. I see the farming and business sides as being quite intertwined. Hence the double DSOP. Farming can be seen as more immediate but the farming activities are guided by the need for income. I guess if I really must choose one over the other I would go for the farming (especially  where to start) as being my weekest point </div></div></div><br/>

This is primarily a document for you for your own use, or for the team who is involved in your project.  I know what you mean how it is easy to get expansive when writing about this.  The more refined you get it though, the more effective you'll be at using it, especially for the types of decisions that you won't necessarily want to spend a lot of time running through the context for. I speak from experience here.  Mine was way too long, and still is to some extent.  Pruning it down to the essentials lets us quickly use the process to get an anwser.  We'll probably always be willing to spend an hour or so to run through a long context when its a very momentous or expensive decision, but for more day to day stuff it might be less likely to do so.  Keep at it.  I don't recall if javan said it in the webinar but first get it down, then get it good!</div></div></div><br/>

I think I've said this before ? the most important thing to do in this REX is to learn how to do things ? if you can't do them now then that's OK as you can come back to us later in the 10 weeks and to some extent after that too when we're in the Regrarians Network space.

Are they on the same track as you and are these goals/future desires part of a consistent vision for the farm and for your family? Maybe split and do one for you or you &amp; your wife, and one for the farm as a whole?</div></div></div><br/>

"What are you managing" is the "whole" correct, and I thought I did answer that as the first question- more detail or what are we looking for there?  My wife has no time for this at the moment but we talk about it.  I decided to make the HC for me since its me doing the process right now, but a separate one for the farm may be a good idea.</div></div></div><br/>

Thanks for clarifying that this is just for yourself - you did say "my HC" in your original post but it's not in the document (in the "Whole" box) so I wasn't sure.</div></div></div><br/>
