They can be, and it depends on how often they were used, how much, what they were, amount of rainfall, existing vegetation, management history... The only real way to know is to get a very thorough soil test, often through an environmental lab specialising in soil/water remediation. Do you know the answers to any of those? They'll help in narrowing down what approaches you may need to consider and things to look out for/beware (or at least be aware) of.</div></div></div><br/>

Also, persistence is generally tested at field application rates (which are often exceeded in a farm application) and in isolation, i.e. not in combination with other common pesticides. If you can find out what may have been used/what's commonly applied in your area to the crops that were previously grown I can do some digging in the literature to see what's out there, or at least point you in the right direction.</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-09 20:15</div><div class="msg">@ @. Hey, guys. The terrain at the sites I am using to go through REX is very hilly and, as I have read and heard many times before, not proper for machinery. My question is, in steep hills like that, for an agroforestry culture (with or without pasture in between), does it make sense to use a keyline pattern? I mean, the contour lines, ridges and valleys are still there and the work would have to be done manually. Would there be any value in the keyline pattern? Thanks and regards.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-09 20:17</div><div class="msg">There is still good value in using it in such situations as it is the only type of pattern in a landscape like that that can provide the best of both contour and grid layouts, - namely, erosion control and equidistance. Off-contour equidistant patterns are used all throughout the world in this type of country. 

In Bulgaria for example this type of pattern is the go to layout for forestry and silvopasture on slopes. Half of the country is non-arable due to the steep slopes.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-09 20:29</div><div class="msg">@ Thanks, Georgi, but why would equidistance be of value without machines needing the space (I can see the value for pasture, more or less, because they could graze in between any patterned shaped planting, no?). Can you point to any example in Bulgaria where I could check GE? About erosion control, I don't think I have enough knowledge to get why would off-contour equidistant patterns be better at it than a grid pattern. I can see why that would be in a more plain terrain that can be ripped in that shape, causing the water to divert to places chosen by the designer. But when you are just making wholes and planting trees  that is not so clear to me. Thanks again for your time and sorry about my lack of experience.</div></div></div><br/>

A more expedient way would be to run the pipe up the primary valley directly to the main ridge. We would save something like 250m of pipe. We also probably wont put roads on our primary ridges because of the size of the block (a firebreak around the boundary and the main ridge road are probably adequate access). What do you think?

We're having a hard time with pages 96 to 100/101 of the RHB on our place. Specifically getting the Keyline Cultivation Pattern for the "fenced" area of our site.

Looking at our site we've got 4? primary valleys in the smaller "semi cleared" fenced area on the east side. Each time we try to apply pages 96-101 we get terribly confused/muddled....leading to the next question

2. What do we do when the keyline pattern (as far as we can see) is against solar access?

The roadblock of the eastern paddock has sort of stopped us from looking at the "western one" (within the fenced area to the west of the main road in), but looking at that now, the same issued seem to crop up)

3. (from Saturday's session, but time got the better of us)

"Assuming the best location for farm roads is on a ridge, what suggestions do you have for when the location/relationship of the ridges with boundaries result in difficult to work with spaces"

If we had to prioritise the questions 1 and 2 are what we're struggling with the most. We assume 3 will spit out from getting the pattern correct." Thanks! <#C60M4EHQQ|2geography></div></div></div><br/>

1. Perhaps you can create some screen shots of the landscapes that you're talking about.

2. Otherwise yes solar access is a consideration ? one has to weigh it up against the water control side of the pattern. The high pruning of trees certainly helps increase solar access as does species selection. i.e. canopy density, leaf to stem ratio, tree density per hectare, height etc. 

3. Regarding road placement ? there's 3 general orientations for roads on a farm:

A. Perimeter - to provide a maintenance access and fire break
B. Contour alignment - gradient roads of typically 1:50 - 1:400 grades that are usually insloped to harvest and control water. 
C. Ridge alignment - roads that utilise the natural camber of the ridge apex however are limited to ridge slopes of less than 20° in order to maintain traction and prevent rutting ? can go steeper where sealed with asphalt or concrete.</div></div></div><br/>

One thing that I had never made the connection about before this course was that Main Ridges could branch and still be considered a Main Ridge. I suppose I had always assumed that if it branched into another ridge that was then a Primary Ridge. I'll see if I can spend some time seeing if I can find a relatively decent map to put the rest of the landscape in context. When I had looked before all I could find was a topo map with 20' contour intervals, which is why I went and got the survey done. Now going through this course if I were to do it again I would have had them survey a much bigger area with less data. </div></div></div><br/>

Trees that we planted in rows just beside access paths/roads are better cared for and are growing twice as fast as those planted in grid pattern on slopes "far" away from access. Don't forget about maintenance, harvest etc.! Maybe land is not suitable for machinery, but that doesn't mean you are not able to do access earthworks. If that is not possible hand made paths are very valuable! Here you can see a good example from our property, where trees are planted beside access terraced road - <a href="https://goo.gl/3XiyaH">https://goo.gl/3XiyaH</a> I can't list all the benefits compared to grid pattern all over the slope.</div></div></div><br/>

I have read through the segment in the Climate chapter of the hand book and looked at a couple websites. I gave up trying to work it out myself and I have managed to generate some data via <a href="http://www.degreedays.net/#generate">http://www.degreedays.net/#generate</a> . What do I now do with this data, and more generally, what do we do with all the data collected in the checklist. How do we best put it to use?" @ Answered at 45:22. @ has an earlier post on this topic, asking What the relevance is of GDD how to calculate and use these metrics. Reason it's in the HB: e.g. you're an apple grower, not familiar with the site, and you want to know 1) the GDD or heat units that you have available because it will indicate what varieties are likely to work best (definitely true for grape growers &amp; ripening periods), and 2) the # of chilling hours available. In the context of multispecies complexes, it gives you a set of guidelines to create a "best bet" list of species. Gives you an idea of what's likely to work and what will be marginal at best. * * * * Supplementary: Thanks Daren that helps. So it seems we need to work it out for each potential crop base value. In the checklist you have 3 rows;  0+, 10+, 15+. Are these base temperatures off which to calculate the degree days? Cheers. At 57:10 -- Yes, they are. Those were chosen because some crops won't grow below 10 (e.g. tomatoes), others below 15 (or those are their upper limits). Also important for ripening = ask yourself: How many day-degrees during the growing season, or over a period, that are above that amount? Is that enough for that variety or species to not only produce flowers &amp; fruit but also to ripen? Important also for Brix levels/ratings, fruit quality, and products that can be made.</div></div></div><br/>

Answered at 1:06:29. Kirk Gadzia: "The biggest one that you can afford." SpeedRite 63000R and Gallagher really make the best energizers in the world. Really pro clients tend to go SpeedRite but both are good. But knowing what you need is important, knowing the difference between AC, DC and AC/DC. Remote control - will test the voltage on the fence while also testing/telling you where there are any faults (shorts), and (third) you can turn the fence off/on. Especially for SpeedRite (<a href="http://www.speedrite.com">http://www.speedrite.com</a>). In the US, Premier1 (<a href="https://www.premier1supplies.com">https://www.premier1supplies.com</a>) supplies in Iowa - actually worth importing from the US to AU even though they were made in NZ... based on pricing policies (saved 60-80% or more on energizer prices).

Can you talk more about how does Keyline design / water catchment and storage varies between dry places and farms where there is a 2000mm yearly precipitation, and usually designers plan for getting water out of the system. Even thought Culebra?s (where my project will be) has a precipitation avg. of 800mm and has a considerable dry period being rain water management my main concern and challenge, most of Puerto Rico has more than double that precipitation and is considered moonsonal, so I will like to understand better the main differences in conceptualization and design in both contexts. Gracias." Answered at 1:19:10.

Can you point me in the right direction?" Answered at 1:31:10 (frost ~1:38:10). Generally have to find the data and look at your nearest weather station data. Talk to those in the area that can corroborate or provide the year that was "the worst year ever." Go to the rainfall data for that particular year (looking over multiple years is really difficult) to find the longest drought period. Drought = lack of effective rainfall (as a very simple answer, one of several). Start with defining what drought means for you &amp; your landscape, then use those metrics to create your plan.</div></div></div><br/>

(Yes). Best way to ensure a 2-3 year water storage capacity is building in depth (with small surface area), and having multiple storages to rely on. Reduce numbers early to avoid feeding/watering stock into drought; keep stock watered off the storage (e.g. in troughs) to keep water storage clean and supply to stock fresh. During a drought, as water levels go down, turbidity increases and quality declines; can add to stress, illness in stock already stressed by declining forage quality. Keeping water clean is one of the easier ways to keep animals (and people) healthy.</div></div></div><br/>

Key is effective and appropriate ground preparation before planting to ensure best success rate that you can. Mulching, earthworks, careful species/variety choices, ripping or manually digging up an area to decompact, amending soil, planning optimal time of year for planting, etc.</div></div></div><br/>

Uploading a kml with a few cultivation lines I'd start with working on. I'm running out the door this morning so they're only a start, but the red polygon gives you an idea of the area I'd actually work with first to get a pattern down. There may be some extension onto the northeast end of the Main Ridge on the the eastern corner (MR6) and down along the southern boundary of that portion of the property, but delineating the major block to focus on and get a pattern worked out will make things easier. It doesn't include headlands and the lines are ~6-8 m apart so may not be the right width for your system but should give you an idea. (And there are only 3 of them, plus a 4th example higher up in the block, because I don't have MapInfo loaded up and can't easily/quickly do parallel offsets in GE). @ or @</div></div></div><br/>
