<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-05 21:32</div><div class="msg">Thanks @ (and @ ),

We've had a lot of different enterprises over the years. 

1. 1993-2004 - we concentrated on design, planning, development and management work

2. 2004-2007 ? worked full-time on a major project for Mars Inc. in Viet Nam

3. 2007-2016 ? global educational outreach with biennial world tours

4. 2017+ ? home based web farm planning, machinery design and manufacturing, media

In each of these 'phases' we applied the same marketing planning techniques that we learned when we did a small biz training course in 1993. 

With phase 1 we started when a fast modem was 14kbs and most people didn't have computers ? we were right on the cusp of that ? we therefore had to outsource desk top publishing and all that fun stuff. The world was slower and less connected. 

We determined that our focus would be back to the land types ? people who had discretionary income available to hire us to  design, develop and manage their projects. 

Our main marketing outlet were farmer field days - sustainable living events and so on. It was expensive compared with Facebook marketing of today. 

What we did was leverage all of the work that we had been able to do by taking (and developing!) lots of photos, displaying our plans, giving away trees, doing live displays and so on. We put a lot of effort in and we were successful in building a customer base that way. 

We did good work and our clients told their friends and on we went. A lot of those early clients are now friends and in the 70's and 80's ? they were in their 40's and 50's then. 

As the internet, desktop publishing and personal computer era arrived we continued to do the field days as even today there's nothing like a personal contact. I often think about doing that again ? though we don't really need to. It was good to learn from all those that you came into contact with as they told you about their land and whilst many of them didn't become customers this was a great way of getting valuable market information. 

So back then we were more reactionary marketers as opposed to having deeply and well executed plans. The space was (and remains dynamic) and our personal lives were (and are) the same. 

If I skip forward to phase 3 ? we determined in 2006 that there was a climate crisis emerging that we felt agriculture had the biggest part to play in correcting. Our broad plan was to use the capital that we'd saved working for Mars Inc. to have us do a series of world tours over a 5 year period which would then result in this regenerative agriculture space expand and have our brand solidly at the centre of this. We were very successful in achieving this, though it was more like a 10 year period not 5.  

By this time we'd entered the social media era and so advertising was a lot simpler. 

Our target customer base remains the same though since the late 90's, as we'd shown we weren't 'crazy hippies', we started to get a lot more work with conventional farmers. That has continued and now we're about 50:50 ? 50% back to the land types and 50% professional farmers. Its great because one feeds the other in terms of innovation and practice. 

Our planning with the REX was borne out of the desire to create more applied training outcomes in Regenerative Agriculture. The chalk and talk model was boring for us as was the whole concentration on techniques ? we needed to create something that was more effective. 

Lisa (my wife and a Director of Regrarians Ltd.) suggested we do 'Open Consultancies' and that worked straight away. People were happy with that model even though it had a significant weak link ? it was focussed on one person's project ? the physical host's site. This works to a point, though ultimately both the 'back to the land' type and professional farmer have something very much in common ? one of their biggest drivers is their own project and so that's where this latest REX model came in.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-05 21:38</div><div class="msg">Last year's #REX2016WorldTour was a great success on a number of levels and was a great marketing project if anything else. It confirmed all that I just spoke about and showed us the flaws and weak links in the open consultancy model. We took that, analysed it and developed this program as a result. 

We don't believe in over-planning things ? when we have in the past we've wasted a lot of time in being too prescriptive. As with nature (and we're apparently part of nature) you have to assume that you are going to be wrong. So this program is an example of where I'm assuming that I'm wrong and so from a planning perspective I'm going super safe as opposed to going super innovative. That's a safe route in the nurturing of our reputation with our market, and limits the costs when too much R&amp;D goes wrong ? which by definition it has to.</div></div></div><br/>

While financial capital is a determining factor, and limiting for many, it's important in regenerative thinking to look at other forms of capital. We can still achieve things with limited dinancial capital. Its all about creativity and attention for me. Where are we putting our intention. We can often replace financial capital with knowledge, time, resources, networks etc. We also need to look for slow capital that's looking to move from the global economy casino and land in resilience projects. Some of the most innovative things I've seen in Latin America come from poor campesino communities where they just need to get things done. Cheers</div></div></div><br/>

The timber appraisal is an actual forester appraisal on 89 acres in Russell County VA about 2 years ago. Sold to a logger, the wood was worth about $120,000. But if processed and sold as molding it would be worth 3.5 to 7 million dollars with capex under $100,000 (if you really splurge; it could be done with 1/2 to 1/3 the capital with some items self funded from profits).

Neither the bank or the seller care how you value the offer as long as it meets the seller's desired sell price and it appraises at or above that price. You can then reduce your basis for the timber value as you sell the processed timber (e.g. $2000 per acre in this example).

The minimum value adding that was recommended was using a portable mill (such as a LucasMill) and air-seasoning on site. 

If one installed a 20' aluminium/insulated ship container dehumidifying kiln onsite then the sale value of that now kiln dried timber increased the ROI considerably. My old mate Charlie Bovalino developed this technology in the early 90's and its now sold in kit form in the US (at least) by Baileys. (<a href="http://www.baileysonline.com/Woodworking/Kilns-Drying/Kilns/Baileys-4K-Dehumidification-Dry-kiln-kit.axd">http://www.baileysonline.com/Woodworking/Kilns-Drying/Kilns/Baileys-4K-Dehumidification-Dry-kiln-kit.axd</a>)

Indeed taking things to the next step and putting this KD timber through moulders etc. only further increases this ROI. (e.g. <a href="https://logosol.com.au/planers">https://logosol.com.au/planers</a>)

In the late 90's Regrarians' developed the following 'Farm Forestry Financial Returns Model' to assist our clients to determine the feasibility of establishing forest plantations on their properties.

Bear with me here, I?ll provide some context to my ultimate question?

When we started this journey of ours we were very much ?permaculture this, permaculture that? but as time went by and we keep reading, listening, and reading some more, and the whole ?permaculture? approach started to make less sense to us ? or rather seemed so massively broad yet so particularly narrow at the same time.

We kept being asked ?when are you doing a PDC?? ?Who?s PDC are you going to take?? or simply, ?you?re not doing permaculture unless you?ve done a PDC.?

So we started looking, none of the courses out there really suited what we felt we needed for our situation and context. It was this journey that lead us to find Darren?s work and we began to feel that there was a way to do what we?d set out to achieve and that making a dollar in the process wasn?t a bad thing?..something we often came up against with the ?permaculture movement?

Anyhow, we?re here, learning, great.

Problem ? we?re in the process of building our farm brand (initially to be used for pastured eggs). ?Permaculture? as a branding tool/exercise is pretty well known, a simple and singular word, something rather handy to paste on something or to place within a branding scenario for example ?Practicing principles of biodynamics, permaculture, and pastured poultry? was one we?d tossed about (admittedly without much thought).

So, what do we do now? We?re not especially wedded to the whole ?permaculture movement? and in some respects feel like we?re moving away from it towards something better ?beyond permaculture? ? Regrarian almost. We can?t use that, as few outside of our little world know what it means, so to describe a product, we don?t feel it?s a useful tag right now as much as we like it (copyright aside). ?Holistic Management?? ?Regenerative Agriculture?? Again neither of these would be well known to a consumer base. Neither fill us with a warm and fussy feeling about a product.

What on earth do we use? How do we come up with a description for the way we intend to operate that the average [hipster?] punter, buying our lovely expensive eggs, will understand that?s just a word or two?</div></div></div><br/>

The marketing words that come with your eggs are not as important as the real value they bring to customers. At the end of the day, your customers will buy your eggs at the price you offer because it has more value than other eggs (be they organic). So I would suggest that you have a look at how Joel Salatin sells his. A great interview can be found below this post, where he speaks about his strategy to sell eggs. Basically he makes it easier for customers (on farmers market) to compare his eggs (higher in price) to organic eggs sold in the local supermaket (the closest to the farmers market). When customers get the difference, only then will your words have the greatest leveraging effect. At that moment, the word "permaculture" will probably not be the best as people don't necessarily grasp how permaculture makes eggs tastier or more nutritive...

As a result, if you search for "permaculture" you will find a lot of material that does not enhance the brand.  My wholesale and grocer customers could care less about permaculture. They care about 1) price 2) organic certification status, 3) product quality, and 4) quality of logistics and delivery. The reality is eggs (and vegetables and meat) including all certified organic are still a commodity product and your ability to charge a premium remains limited by the larger commodity market EVEN IF YOU SELL DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER.</div></div></div><br/>

We're not so much concerned about the farm to wholesaler value proposition, that's all fairly straight forward. But as @ says, other things being equal, what is the "why"? why would a consumer buy our eggs (price being the same) over another brand. This is a marketing exercise, we've got the brand, but how do we describe the brand to reflect our context and MO? Its not "Nike" we're after, its coming up with a "Just do it" and initially we were going to have a heavier emphasis on "permaculture", but as I say, we're not really wedded to it anymore. In Australia, amongst the "organic buyer set" its a well known term....also the circles we're in, its a well known term anyway - our daughter goes to a Steiner School, you can go to an event and drop the "P" word and people know exactly what you're on about....but its just not us anymore</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-19 23:52</div><div class="msg">Thanks @ ? our own position is that its often best to not wed yourself to someone else's brand lest you get the reputational residue of their behaviours. This is one of few reasons why we dropped 'Permaculture' and have distanced ourselves from a number of other brands as well. 

Permaculture per se is not a quality brand, its a quantity brand ? Mollison in his evangelism phase of the late 70's to the late 90's made no effort to create any QA over the brand or practice. He left it to the market to determine who was good at PC and who was not. This created the conditions for the poor reputation of the brand in a number of markets. 

HM on the other hand is a quality brand as the QA was there from the start. Its now becoming a quantity brand whilst still maintaining its quality as well. This speaks volumes about the two methodologies. 

With Regrarians® we created our own word and brand and have adopted the QA approach of HM from the start. 

Our broader advice with clients is to not latch onto terms such as 'free-range' or 'organic' or 'artisanal' and so on. Regenerative Agriculture is becoming an unregulated buzz term too, much in the same way 'Sustainable Agriculture' is as well. 

Certainly being certified organic has its benefits to gaining market access when you're running a more global value chain, but if you're doing local marketing then we've not seen it to be necessary. In fact we've worked with some clients to cultivate a narrative that highlights some of the limitations of certification.</div></div></div><br/>

I share your disdain for wanky terms and I think "artisan/artisanal" is definitely heading in that direction!  Even though it is a valid descriptor.  I reckon we ought to focus on TASTE, after all, it is with our senses that we consume food.  Mass-produced food has resulted in a collective dulling of the senses, so much so that it has to be loaded with sugar and/or salt to make it taste edible, and we all know the immense taste difference between a supermarket tomato or strawberry and a home-grown one.  Fry a carton of caged eggs next to a carton of free range and the visual difference is obvious.  Ultimately, taste is what makes us coming back for more, so I'd emphasise that.  And if it's more nutrient-dense and sustainably/regeneratively/ethically/holistically raised then we're all the better for it!</div></div></div><br/>

You could also use words taken directly from your Holistic Context. 
Another thing, too. I think you don't HAVE to position your eggs necessarily as better that everyone else. Knowing with precision who you compete with will help a lot. So I have a question for you :slightly_smiling_face: who is/are your tougher competitor and why ? Organic because the organic label reads easily ? Free range because of quality ?

It was titled, "The Organics Industry ? More labels than Beer brands" ? my schtick that day was that there is brand confusion in the marketplace and that this needed to be something that the industry needed to deal with. 

I've been working in the certified Organic food and beverage sector since 1989 and so have seen that since then and then 11 years later with that speech and now 19 years later that the number of brands in this space has increased considerably such that there is even greater brand confusion. 

Furthermore there has been a increase in the number of certifiers too ? certification itself has become an industry. Look a lot of labels and the real estate taken up by all of the certifiers logos...

Goodness knows where it will all be in 10 years time. I have some ideas :slightly_smiling_face:

Some people are starting to ask questions and having the answers right there would be a good thing I reckon. Doing so is also a courtesy to the whole industry I believe (including conventional, whatever they call themselves) I'm currently  having some personal developments, say happening around this subject: I grow organic, I'm certified. Top notch stuff, pristine land, pristine inputs, going through a lot of trouble getting them, ... it ticks a fair few boxes, but I don't seem to get that story out there enough: The unprotected terms relating to organic allows people to call themselves whatever( spray free chemical free, natural, it goes on) Sure there are producers out there who genuinely are those things and beyond that. This is where one of our current difficulties lays. People don't ask the questions to verify. The amount of times I've first handed known people to be surprised about the glyfosate, conventional fertilisers, seed coatings, seedlings, drenches on animals,... their ' spray free' grower uses that they've been buying their food from. 
It is unbelievable. a fair few shops do the same and where does it end. Going out there pointing fingers is not a very nice thing to do, growers are just people who mostly try to do their best in their situation, which is just a product of their circumstances, not much blame and still some respect there for me. My partner and some team members have been discussing this for quite some time, we're kind of trying to sell to the same clients, just at a slightly higher price. What's the difference people ask( well did you know... not so nice) Our approach is going to be to try to get those customers to pose the right questions and to supply those who are interested with our do's and do nots. I believe with this hopefully respectful and non violent &amp; pushy approach we might not only educate consumers, but also nudge a few more growers on their labelling and practises hopefully too.</div></div></div><br/>

I was trying to see who I could ask regarding a good accounting and management software for a multi-enterprise farm operation (markets, &lt;5 employees, csa, egg production, value added goods) I plan to do the accounting in house and it appears there is an endless amount of programs out there I was hoping for  any recommendations on programs you have experience with. Thanks!</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-03 00:30</div><div class="msg">I'm going to add my two cents.  How about something simple like "naturally grown", "raised as nature intended" naturally raised" "farmed naturally" "taste the difference" etc. on the front package. Then a short blurb about what this means for your product - free range, fresh pasture, no chemicals, soil improvement etc. on the inside of the carton cover and a small poster where you sell the eggs, if possible.  </div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-03 02:03</div><div class="msg">Unfortunately, "naturally grown" is meaningless without quite a large investment in brand building. While certified organic has limitations, including foreign cheating, allowing some "organic" natural chemicals that are still toxic, and higher costs (especially for things like certified organic hay that may not even be available or economic), it is the only viable option for selling large volumes of product through wholesale and grocer commodity markets. Certified organic does get a premium price. However, it is very difficult to get that sort of a premium without the certification in wholesale / large volume markets. Joel Salatin gets $20 per chicken and $14 per pound for boneless skinless chicken breasts but he can only do that after decades of work building his brand and by selling into one (Washington DC metro area) of about a dozen markets that can pay these prices. When conventionally raised chickens go for $5 whole cooked at Costco and under $2 per pound, there just are not that many buyers at that sort of a premium price - especially when even the organic sells for maybe $4-$5 per pound (at the grocery store) and even less wholesale.</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-03 15:26</div><div class="msg">@ Whew... what a thread! Great conversation here. Rob Avis and I have been speaking of this very thing as of late on an upcoming podcast and with participants of the Regenerative Business Mentorship program. Consider that one of the most valuable assets in your land management is your cognitive process and how it plays out on the landscape. There's a large elephant in the room of 'urban ignorance'. Most folks want to know their food is good and a few want it to be incredible. Labels and brands inherently have baggage that come with them but the largest baggage is that of jargon. Pasture raised, free run, organic, vegetarian fed, biodynamic, on and on the list goes. If the market is educated and looking for the brand, fantastic. Align and sell. But if they aren't, and in my neck of the woods (Western Canada) the majority of folks are not educated. So how is a farmer to differentiate their product? There's a few ways 1)The work  of creating the product (the management, process, etc) 2) The reputation of those producing the product 3) the sales process. Most farmers I work with have a COMPLICATED sales process. For meat, there's cut lists, hanging weight, hoof weight, on and on the jargon goes. The confused mind says no and the more jargon and complexity your sale process provides to potential clients the less likely the clients are going to say yes. Having a sales process that's easy and dare I say enjoyable can more easily differentiate you then almost any other category as it's one of the hidden areas that farmers ignore. Like any entrepreneur you wear all the hats or delegate/outsource the roles necessary to produce, convert, and sell your product. The second way to differentiate is your reputation, both yours (the people) and the farm. How? Understand and detail out your Point of View. How you look at the world. What motivates you. A colleague, Tad Hargrave, is leading in this field. A great ebook on POV to take a look at can be found here <a href="http://bit.ly/2u4H0nG">http://bit.ly/2u4H0nG</a> . The other part of reputation is ensuring that what you say matches what you do. If you speak of raising animals humanely there needs to be a corresponding behaviour to match. Which leads us into the The Work. Grinding it out so to speak. How you grind can provide a differentiation point for customers. The process. Consider that when you speak about how many m2 or ft2 your chickens have to roam, the average consumer doesn't know about CAFO's or battery raised chickens. However if you speak to your customers that the average chicken in a factory operation never sees a human, and the egg is only touched by human hands when you pull it out of the carton whereas you see your chickens 2-3 times a day and inspect everything along the way, that's a point of distinction to a price insensitive market. The poultry farmers I was working with were raising the most ethical eggs with the highest quality out put I'd seen. They were charging $3.50/doz. Criminal. The market on organic eggs averages $6-9/doz and they had product differentiation on top of organic inputs. Currently they're sold out at $9.50 after working together. Same conversation about their broilers. Circles of trust is what we're talking about when we speak of labels. When you tip your hat to those circles and say, "Thanks, but no thanks, we'll 'certify' ourselves." You're doing what food aggregators are doing, become the trust circle as a certain demographic of eaters don't trust the grocery store anymore (for good reason). You are leveraging trust. It's what Primal Pastures did after becoming a producer that people trusted, they brought in other products that was up to their standard and customers were thrilled to have someone CURATE their dinner table. Consider that you are a curator of living edible art. From conception to stomach and as we're learning more about the gut microbiome the rest of the GI tract what we eat on every level curates who we are.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-03 15:26</div><div class="msg">Yes there are a tiny minority who may be able to get $20 and $25 / kg ($9.09 to $11.36 pound) for non-certified organic meat. My problem with using these sort of numbers is that they are very unrealistic benchmarks that can lead to bad decisions precisely because they are outlier data points &gt;3 standard deviations from the mean (for retail prices) that are representative of well under 0.001% of the market. There are very few customers who can and will pay these prices and most of those are in a very limited number of locations in the US.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-03 15:28</div><div class="msg">Differentiate yourself through 1) the work, 2) your reputation and 3) your sales process and remove yourself from the game that everyone else is playing.

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-03 15:32</div><div class="msg">I get the whole differentiate yourself thing but there are distinct limits to the volumes of product you can move at super premium prices. These are all commodity markets and the customers are subject to market forces. Joel Salatin's model only works because of his scale and his location (selling into the Washington DC market). At $6 per whole chicken, his business model would not work. Likewise, while he has enough market for perhaps 20,000 to 50,000 chickens at $20, he would over saturate his market if he tried to sell 100,000 let along millions.</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-03 18:06</div><div class="msg">@  There are multiple ways to generate above average returns in a commoditized market - particularly a) the use of leverage (3% to 5% yielding debt vs higher cost equity) b) developing operational efficiencies, c) lowering costs, and d) vertical integration across multiple stages of the value chain from production to processing to shipping to distribution. Branding has limited effectiveness when you are dealing with a commodity product that meets commodity market specifications - even the big consumer food branding companies are having a hell of a time differentiating their brands against both generic (store) brands and competing products and are finding that they are wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising that has little impact beyond increasing their cash spending burn rates. Leverage is only an option for highly securitized areas that have large amounts of capital assets. Every farm product is ultimately a commodity product competing in a commodity market with wholesale and retail pricing tiers (and occasionally conventional vs organic tiers) - even if you are selling $20 "natural / beyond organic / pastured / [insert your preferred branding here]" chickens, you are competing against both retail and wholesale channels as well as against institutional ones (the $5 cooked whole chicken at Costco), truck discount outfits like Zaycon <a href="http://www.zayconfresh.com">http://www.zayconfresh.com</a> selling cases of chicken at $1.89 per pound to end consumers, restaurants/fast food chains, and even substitutes for chicken (beef; pork; vegetarianism; veganism) -- all of which inject price pressures on your ability to charge a premium price above the retail market.</div></div></div><br/>

You can either choose to accept average returns or have a mindset that you wont. I cant say I share your views that a $20 chicken competes with a $5 one,. That aside, if that's your mindset than that's what will occur. If you do the same as everyone else you'll be the same. Want average commodity returns? be average, do as others do. Want something better? do something better, do something different.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-03 22:24</div><div class="msg">@ I've just had time to read through this thread, it's fantastic. For what it's worth, Hubby and I did a pastured egg course with PROOF a few months back (to learn more about pastured chickens not intending to be under their banner)  The farm that we went to - yes the chickens were pastured (but set stocked in permanent fox proof paddocks) and the people were really lovely - but it was a world away from regenerative and not even close to 'sustainable'. It did not fit in at all with our vision and to be honest we were kind of disheartened that this was the standard they were pushing to be the next top notch thing. There was also a huge push by PROOF on why pastured should be certified and it really sent off alarm bells in my head, like it was a niche they had seen and were trying to "claim" - but this was just the way we felt about it. 
From what I have observed people who are successful in this market just tell their story and run their enterprise in line with the things that are really important to them and that they are passionate about doing differently - then along come the customers who resonate with their story and care about seeing change.. of whom there are many - and many more blissfuly unaware who will hear these stories and make different/ better choices.. </div></div></div><br/>

Lisa came away with a similar "bad taste" on several issues....a similar vein to what you've outlined. Regardless, Lisa is off to do their chicken course next weekend (we're tacking a little holiday on to it). The only thing that appeals to me is that Lee seems willing to go into bat to help IF something goes wrong with authorities etc. I'm not sure what we're doing yet, but membership is cheap and might be good hand holding for the first year or two....we'll sign up for Chicken Caravan's program too probably.

I do follow Chicken Caravan a bit - they are great - very helpful! To be honest, it's probably where we have found most of our most useful knowledge - particually with portable fencing etc. I didn't actually realise they ran a program, I will have to look into it :blush: No doubt Lisa will learn a lot from the PROOF course, it was very thorough and a great introduction for those thinking of getting in to eggs. We have kept chickens on a backyard scale our whole lives and came away with a heap of new knowledge about them - was definitely worth doing :blush:</div></div></div><br/>

I can speak to a little of your question on Joel's revenues but for not for his P&amp;L. We were Joel's international agents for a few years and so we handled a lot of his work through our books. Before that we hired him for about 20 days a year from 2009. Last time I talked about it with him his speaking fees constituted less than 10% of Polyface Farm's income. Most of that income goes directly into developing the farm. Remember they don't take any NRCS or other funds they're entitled to and so fund their capital development out of their farm revenues. 

Polyface is certainly the exception to the rule when it comes to the proportion of total revenue from education-based activities. 

There are any number of examples where the 90:10 rule applies not the 10:90 that is the case at Polyface.</div></div></div><br/>

My instinct has been that he is the exception to the rule. I estimate that he does about ~$2 +/- million in annual revenues based on his staffing and footprint. His biggest competitive advantage is his marketing skills and buyer's club system with pickup locations spread throughout the Washington DC, Richmond, and Charlottesville metro areas (that have the income to support his pricing). He probably could double his volumes/revenues but he would quickly reach limits (land; market; management control; financial capital; staffing headaches) that would either prevent him from growing too much or would require doing things that he does not want to do (e.g. violate his holistic context).</div></div></div><br/>

They also had another 1000-1500 acres of leased grazing country which runs around 7-800 head + broilers and layers ? these are operated by former interns/apprentices on an incentive. Polyface owns the stock they own the operation, someone else owns the property. 

The amount of leased ground is variable from year to year as agreements change with succession events, operators get their own places and so on.

Apart from the very interesting dam testing, and related data included, I suppose what you are sharing here is mostly about the way of thoroughly thinking a particular system and testing value. The 2ml/ha target is only 200mm, meaning I guess that this is in water country. 1- Have you got collated  info on different pasture/covercrops minimal water needs. 2- Correlated ml/ha with forage weight. 3- Basic AD for different animals: cattle, sheep, pigs, goat, rabbit, chicken. Many thanks.</div></div></div><br/>

It's absolutely fab to be in the 'give, take and everybody advances' mindset. You can do quite a few things with it, but it only gives you your potential earnings per square meter. For input cost per bed and/ or per square meter I personally use a very simple spreadsheet with each thing you do to the crop on a square meter bases ( from the very first prep, to seed, seedling, fertiliser, minerals, irrigation(I make two different prices often, particularly with irrigation as I use fuel to drive a pump and I get rebate, so I know what the bare minimum of money I've spend on it is), all the way to the washing and boxing, row covers, cleaning up the crop, anything I can imagine. For most Items I keep two prices, one is a bare minimum one so I know somewhat when I'm making a loss, or to what price I could drop if need be. For ease of working I look at the local contractor rate for machinery work and the local price for other things like seedlings(this also gives some benchmark to become competitive in the farm's own nursery enterprise) for all work done I charge my personal rate irrespective of who does the actual job. When for eg planting or mechanical weeding I do the contractor rate plus however many staff on the implement. The contractor rate I figure should pay for the maintenance and depreciation, I know there is a large difference in running costs for different implements, but that probably balances. Anyway I wack all that stuff in the spreadsheet and then look at my minimum yields per square meter to expect work out that price per piece or kg per square meter and then I usually (depending again on a few factors like what would people be willing to pay, local area, other growers...) add another margin for the farm. It's on one hand pretty rough, but it can on the other hand have some finesse too.(Using the minimum yield means I'm less likely to have to pay for adverse conditions or whatever causes a minimum yield, ( I take already heaps of risks to provide awesome food for people, that I figure I don't want to gamble on that one too)  It got me going, it might be of value for others too. I've found quickly with this approach that I can set a few base prices for just a few different 'styles' of crops with their similar treatements and make further data entry not as crucial. Also with this knowledge I then had I saw a few things that seemed quite expensive products to sell after all the margins etc. but when I sold the products(and sure they sold, slow at first though) I felt comfortable and 'righteous' to do so because of the knowledge I had gained about it. On another note I'm pleased to be moving on to more sophisticated Ag software. I'm currently going for a program called AgSquared. You've got to pay for it, but the features it has, I think warants that more than enough. We'll see how we go with it this season. Cheers</div></div></div><br/>

Are you able to give us a little insight into how you have structured your company / non profit community organisation etc? We have established a self assessed not for profit community organisation for ourselves with a goal of promoting regenerative agriculture. I am not sure what other people in this group understand the options and structures available...</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-09 00:49</div><div class="msg">Thanks Ivan, 

I'm not sure what a 'self assessed not for profit community organisation' means ? what is the corporate profile of this organisation? Is it an incorporated association or otherwise?

Regrarians Ltd.'s corporate structure is pretty simple ? we established a 'Public Company Limited by Guarantee' ? our accountant set this up such that the articles provide that this company is a not-for-profit (don't know the details there completely). With this we needed to nominate another non-profit organisation that, should Regrarians Ltd. become insolvent or close, any assets would be directed to ? we chose Landcare Australia in that case. Of course we're not looking to have that happen, however its one of the requirements as we understand it. 

This structure needs a minimum of 3 directors which works really well for us as we don't like quorum based systems ? reminds us way to much of all those committee's we've been involved in over the journey :wink:

You have to come up with a 'Statement of Purpose' as well and this needs to be very well crafted in order to be clear what the boundaries of operations might be. Regrarians Ltd. is as follows:

The objects for which the Company is established are (extracted from Schedule 1 of the ASIC ?Certificate of Registration of a Company?):

???Regrarian?, a neologism of ?Regenerative Agrarian?, is a term first coined by Darren J Doherty in 2013 to describe those who are actively undertaking the serious &amp; timely process of regenerating, restoring, rehabilitating, rekindling and rebooting production landscapes, be they urban or rural, across the world. 

The primary directive of Regrarians Limited entity is to the regenerative enhancement of the biosphere?s ecosystem processes. The secondary directive of Regrarians Limited is to internationally provide the potential for people to be informed about the regenerative economy by the delivery of extension, media, education, goods &amp; materials, whether it involves their work in primary production, other themes of land management, extractive industries, corporate life, domestic services, manufacturing and other activities that are within the reasonable domain of humans ? and to undertake and pursue all such other similar, related or compatible objects as may from time to time be considered appropriate by the Company??

I hope this helps!</div></div></div><br/>
