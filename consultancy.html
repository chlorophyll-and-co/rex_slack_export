There is a large piece of property (100ac) next door that has been for sale for years.  It has just been sold to developers who have informed the community that they want to develop into Eco tourism with 20 or more cabins.  I contacted them and said I was a permaculture designer and would they like some help with the design.  They said yes and I am meeting them on Thursday for the first time.  If they want to hire me I would use my current Permie skills with REX to create a plan.  My question is how much should I quote them (this is the largest job I have done, previous largest was 7 ac).  I thought I would charge $600 per day and am thinking it would take 5-10 days depending on the level of detail.

The other point to look at is how much do you need to earn - a fundamental of Holistic Management Financial Planning is to you planning your pricing such that your Holistic Context is taken care of - safe to say if you don't plan (and charge and work the hours) for that then you're less likely to get it. The market will bear particular rates and a rate is one thing the value you deliver is another</div></div></div><br/>

Although they vary even by position within specific companies. The ones I am familiar with with this #pricing structure also offer health insurance, 401k matching, and bonuses/other benefits. If you want to run a consulting firm then I encourage you to further research this model. I also agree with Darren. The holistic mgmt model and other personal finance models (see mr money moustache) start with defining your financial needs and qty of time available then billing based on this with feedback from what the market will bear. Remember you want to be the price setter not the price receiver :smiley:</div></div></div><br/>

He's very involved in vineyard planning, grazing, design, and on-the-ground trials. Some really interesting work and inspiring results. He'd be my absolute first recommendation and would likely either help or give you a good headstart on getting further direction.</div></div></div><br/>

I have not heard of any Keyline vineyard plantings anywhere in the county.  That doesn't mean they don't exist but if they do I don't think they are any of the bigger players.

Most plantings seem to be done irrespective of even contour. Though sometimes you find them.  I have heard figures like that for the install.  There are some folks who are doing more regenerative methods of viticulture here though.  You might inquire with Michael Presley of Davero in Healdsberg, or Joe Preston.  I believe preston is incorporating grazing into their vines.</div></div></div><br/>

Most people will wrap the tank in some concrete mesh (200mm x 200mm x 6m) and then grow some kind of a vine on it. Others will plant a tall shrub and then others, like me, have stunning 36KL corrugated Stainless Steel header tank which is just beautiful. 

A big problem in the US compared with here in AU is the lack of tank choices and that's long been a commercial opportunity that hasn't been taken up. Here we any number of manufacturers and the best choice of any market in the world. 

With the renovation revolution tank makers have been very innovative such that we have modular tanks that are not only  aesthetic but also highly functional. 

Their is a certain cache (and value) that comes with these tanks being installed.

I am familiar with Kelly at paicines, and will try to get in touch.  Also thanks Tom, I will see if any of the folks you mentioned might be able to point in a useful direction as far as regenerative viticulture is concerned and hopefully I can help my neighbor get things moving in a good direction on their land.  I appreciate the direction and hopefully we can get another couple acres here under good management.</div></div></div><br/>
