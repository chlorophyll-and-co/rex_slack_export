My apologies to those of you who were excluded from the Webinar this morning. This was entirely my fault as I overlooked our account status and was caught out by the 25% of registrations that occurred in the last 3 days. I've since upgraded the account (from 'starter' to 'pro') and so we'll not have that problem again.

Luckily we were able to record the session (thanks @theron !) and so this will be sent here as soon as its available.

Cheers and thanks for being a part of this.

Onwards!

Darren</div></div></div><br/>

One thing I would like to add from Darren?s presentation that really stuck with me when I did the REX2Kansas course was his emphasis on ?water and wire.? I didn?t specifically hear @regrarians say that during his presentation (although my internet crapped out for a few minutes so I might have missed it) so I wanted to add that to the discussion when tackling the issue of applying the platform to a property. There are a lot of details to consider but if we are able to take care of those two layers we can then more easily fit all the other layers into that framework. That has helped me a lot because where I?m currently at is developing the infrastructure around the property I manage and those are some pretty key infrastructure pieces to get right.</div></div></div><br/>

Just these last few days I worked on a project where the platform was not followed, even though it was called a Keyline property. Trees and fences were put prior to water and roads. And now that the water, roads and buildings are being put a lot of that previous work has to be undone. I suggest to not  isolate any layer or a group of layers. Follow the platform with the long term in mind, then figure out the steps you need to take in the present  - be it a focus on water and wire or anything else -  to move in that ultimate direction. Doing this will spare you from many headaches.</div></div></div><br/>

In any case I agree with @g.pavlov and as I said in an interview with @mattpowers the other week, I regret that I didn't see the power that lays in the application of the #KeylineScaleOfPermanence and how even though #PAYeomans didn't place any emphasis on it, I think its application is what really makes a #Keyline design...</div></div></div><br/>

That's forestry layer if I'm correct. I also thought that forestry is all about THE FOREST, but it's much more than that.

I think the best thing for right now is that we calmly follow the REX Program as it is and not get too far ahead of ourselves. I designed this program based on my experience of working with tens of 1000's of people as either clients or students. Taking the time in the sequence we?ve laid out would be advisable from our end. 

That said the 1-10 #RegrariansPlatform channels are there to have general discussions about our projects as they pertain to each layer.</div></div></div><br/>

We do not have any ownership rights. Owners (husband and wife) are not living here. They come every now and then, once every two months. Just to check a little bit. We have a lot of free will to do what we want here. 

We have a legal agreement about renting this place for free. For one year. We sign these contract every year. We are now 5 people on the paper and three of us are living here full time, the other two are "flying" around.

Equity, i think, is the source of most challenges we have when it comes to development of this place, enterprises and our life on it.

It was a subconscious thing at first but in the past year it became quite clear to us.

We were talking with the owners about this, but we were really not confident enough, we didn't present the real "offer". 

It's also clear that they didn't wanted to sign any long term contract.

Financialy we put equal amount of money together each month for costs of living here - electricity, food etc.

What bothers us the most is the money that we invest in daily life and it's directly connected to the repair&amp;care of infrastructure/land. It's small money as we have no capital, but for us is drop by drop - geting bigger from day to day.</div></div></div><br/>

We were living in our world till now and this has to change. I feel they need to become part of the community if we want to sort this out. Also we as individuals are getting to know our own climate more and more. When all individual climates (including owners) are clear we can work to merge all this chaos into something real. We thought that we build the vison/context 4 years ago, but it was simply too airy. Thanks for your support! I know i can't get any certain/concrete answers/tricks, but it's good to have someone out there who knows "the hard" questions.</div></div></div><br/>

Project Storage 

I mentioned on the Orientation Webinar and this week#Live1 session that you should create your own folder in 'that weeks' folder. 

Meaning:

1. Go to the REX10WeekProgram Google Drive
2. Click on 'this weeks' folder ? this week its WK01 ? so click on that folder
3. Click the big blue 'NEW' key in the top left hand corner
4. Select 'New Folder'
5. Type your name and/or project name in the dialog box that appears
6. Click on your new folder name
7. Click the big blue 'NEW' key in the top left hand corner
8. Select either 'File Upload' or use Google Docs, Sheets or Slides
SHARING:
9. If you want to share this folder or any files then right click on the folder or file and select 'Share'
10. Select 'Anyone with the link can edit' or 'can view'
11. In the same window select 'Copy Link'
12. Paste that link in a conversation or thread
13. OR You can click the '+' symbol to the left of this Slack dialog box and select either of the Google Drive options there.</div></div></div><br/>

Yet the logger sells it to the sawmill for $1 who gets $3 to $5+ for a kiln dried rough board; add $1 if it is planed; can get as much as $10 per board foot for molding or flooring.

I strongly suspect that your forester is offering pennies on the dollar. You might want to think about small scale logging and processing converting your trees into molding, flooring, and other high value wood products. You likely have 60,000+ board feet worth of timber that could be worth as much as $600,000 if processed. Before you do anything, you need to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Full-Value-Forestry-timber-community-ebook/dp/B00INC8LF8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499478981&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=solar+timber+kiln">https://www.amazon.com/Full-Value-Forestry-timber-community-ebook/dp/B00INC8LF8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499478981&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=solar+timber+kiln</a> and at least price a small setup. His numbers are real - I have confirmed them. This is a major influence for me. I came up with this on my own but found the author to be a source of confirmation of what I had researched. My only limitation is I need 350,000+ board feet of usable lumber per year for 2.5 years to make components needed for the NY projects so I decided to save my timber for later and acquire processed lumber to remove the schedule risk. Do this right (even with $100,000 of borrowed capex) you could literally use this to pay for your property and another one.</div></div></div><br/>

Interesting thoughts on speed of change ? it goes both ways as most humans are quite reluctant/resistant to change, this is why I have it there in #1climate. 

Lets hope that the #10energy of people changes such that they do change management and practice such that they can then potentially stabilise.

Yes our definition for intensive agriculture is different then the county we live in so we should probably find a better term to use in place of it. The land we are on is considered " ESA-2" "Environmentally Sensitive Area" because we drain to the state park, natural spring many land uses are not permitted including some agricultural practices. The county defines intensive agriculture as this: "Intensive agriculture. Intensive agriculture means those farming and agricultural operations or uses requiring an industrial waste or wastewater permit from the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation [Protection]. Existing agricultural activities as of the date of adoption or subsequent amendment of these land development regulations will not be required to obtain a special use permit from the county for those existing agricultural activities, except as provided herein. Expansion or change of existing agricultural activities after the date of adoption or subsequent amendment of these land development regulations for which an industrial waste or wastewater permit is required form the state for that expansion or change will also require a special use permit from the county, unless the expansion or change is required by the state to maintain the same livestock population of the activity as existed on the date of adoption or subsequent amendment of the land development regulations."  We interpret this as commercial feedlots or operations where a large number  80+of animals are confined in an structure or small area. We have interest of caring for 2-5 goats and 1-2 Llamas or Alpacas, and 20 chickens. And everything we are planning to implement would have them grazing on pasture and herded in to their coop and shelter by night. We have no prior experience with livestock so we have a long way to go! And for once we agree with the county regulation :slightly_smiling_face:</div></div></div><br/>

Thanks for uploading and providing a good amount of detail. You note that you have incomes off the farm that are sufficient to support you. What kind(s) of seedlings did you purchase, why, and at what cost? What might be options for holding those over until next year or a later opportunity when you have a concrete plan in place? I'm sure if you read back through many of the REXteam and participants' comments you'll find so many regrets about work done that they would undo now having their plan in place. Why do the fences need fixing if no one is living onsite? Will a caretaker be able to effectively prevent poaching? What would they be living in, as there are no buildings on site? What was taking place on the site before you bought it a month ago? Can you be onsite yourself frequently enough to deter poachers/trespassing and to get a good feel for the site as you're planning? I think you've made a lot of decisions ("We need to.." , "We'll have to..." , "X will have to be done"...) but without knowing your holistic context and what you really want to achieve, you're liable to run into creating more problems down the road than solving them with short-term fixes. Those are my initial thoughts... And - from experience (hard learned!!) - how do you slow down? You choose to. It really is that simple. (Sorry, I hope that doesn't come across as condescending as it's not meant that way in the least).</div></div></div><br/>

Regarding illegal hunting -- is this primarily of peccaries for bushmeat, or is there any activity for jaguars and other cats? Or other important wildlife, such as birds (e.g. a local feather/pet trade?) What are existing populations of wildlife likely to be targeted for hunting? How many cows roam on to your property for grazing? Are there notable damage patterns you've observed? What was/were the mechanism(s) of fence damage - cattle, trespassing, old age, weather, ... ? other? I'm going to leave these here but suggest that you let them sit without answering immediately, and really double down on the holistic context work while you have the undivided attention of @jkbernak and @helen_lewis and @wardy to focus on those questions.

We have established a rough puchase price for the leased block - there will be some negotiation involved.
We decided to consider buying it, as it is/ was very run down (fences, infrastructure, pastures)  and we have/continue to invest capital into it's restoration. We are thinking that we are better to be putting money into an assets we own if possible? And also can see that the farm is much more viable as a whole. Sercurity &amp; stability are quite important to me and lack of them seem to be an underlying cause of anxiety. We are in the privileged position of owning our property in West Gippsland, which is valued slightly higher than the lease block, so we would essentially be swapping one for the other... if &amp; when we bite the bullet and decide to move!
At present the water from the Steavenson is accessed via a pump run by an old tractor  (so uses diesel) pumped via hose into conventional channels and then released into bays. 
I am very much looking forward to diving into all of the possiblities! :blush:</div></div></div><br/>

Few Q's if I may?
1. What's the local vibe re the future of the Jaguar and other cross-border species given the rhetoric of your Pres.? Some of the Chihuahua-based ranchers at last year's #REX5Mexico were very concerned after all of the bi-lateral work that'd been done for many years. 
2. How heavy an impact are regulations for your site?

4. Does the $100K include your income?</div></div></div><br/>

This paper was one I have shared with others in the past when asking them to show greater support for farming.  This paper was beneficial in the past when thinking about farming in terms of #9economy and #1climate.  It is a nice one hour read to make one ponder efficiency and farm size.  Many of us at the REX have recently or in the last few years found newer sources of information supporting farming.  Now if I was going to direct someone to a source supporting farming, the #RegrariansPlatform would be one of my recommendations.</div></div></div><br/>

How interesting that you should get to setting on one of the subdivided lots of an old client of mine. I designed this flood irrigation system in the mid-90's ? looking at the aerial photo I can see that the irrigation channel is still there. 

Unfortunately this design was in the pre-digital era for me and so I don't have any records on the backup (goes back to 1996ish). I might have some out in the file cabinets in the container on our farm. 

I do recall that the client (I think his name was Ralph) did use amendments on those paddocks. 

The layout of fencing was already well established when I came into the picture. 

Somehow I doubt that you'd get access to this water ? do you know if its still Ralph's family or a different owner?

Fine location ? well done! With a more secure (i.e. surface) water supply you'll have quite the system going!</div></div></div><br/>

Tesla tiles being promoted as we bought the place and i thought they would be great on a new house, but that is a way off. More likely to use regular solar panels on the shed/workshop as that should happen sooner. But will need good storage and powerwall 2 seems like it could be the way to go? 2. I specified LPG as the property has no services but I will hopefully be getting a wood stove also. There is lots of big hawthorn trees for firewood. I would love a rocket stove mass heater and cooker. 3. Good news. I am holding off on getting an engineer to help design the driveway (cathment) and dam (top of the property), in the hopes I can figure it out with help through the course. 4. Yes, as property is zoned farming we need to prove we need to live there full time to farm (24hrs a day basically) in order to build a house to live in.

The border issues are quite complex, as you can assume. There are a number of environmental conservation groups working on preserving land in the area that is vital for the jaguars migratory path from the south. A number of cameras have been set up in all the mountain ranges in order to document what's there so those areas are able to get federal help through, I believe, things like the endangered species act. This work is also in an attempt to preserve critical habitat from mining companies that are trying to develop in the area. As for the wall, there's already a wall through the area where one is capable of being built. Trump's ignorance of the region is crystal clear when it comes to this topic. There are canyons where it is impossible for a wall to be built, which are now the only areas left for migratory land animals to cross the border. One thing I have noticed since Trump has taken office is the increase of border patrol officers in the area. They have a pretty significant impact because they are constantly patrolling through all the remote areas along the border, which extends all throughout the mountain regions. In a more promising note, a camera has spotted a second male jaguar in the area in recent months. 2. Regulations are something I honestly haven't dived into. It's probably my weakest link in my knowledge of developing the site and just don't really know where to start looking. For what I've done so far, which is mainly been focused on getting infrastructure in place, I run project ideas across contractors and ask them if what I'm thinking would require permitting or anything. My biggest concern so far has been with the idea of building a dam across my valley, but at the moment I'm actually thinking that might not be a good idea anyway considering the steepness of the valley slopes. The other consideration I've had is regarding the growing of food on the property to be used in the camps. My plan is when it comes time to slaughter the lambs I will be taking them to an FDA regulated facility for that. 3. The new road did great and water flowed really well into the little pond we began to excavate. Where the road crosses the middle of the valley the slope seems to mellow out a little. Water still flows but looks like it doesn't drain in this area as much as the rest, if that makes sense. 4. The $100k does not include my salary. In the past before I came when the camp was just starting it did include the salary for the property manager but not any more. </div></div></div><br/>

Last year I was given a copy of "10 Acres Enough" by Edmund Morris (1864) ? it was given to me by Rick Thomas who leads the animal power training program at Sterling College in Vermont (USA). I found the case it laid out compelling and true. (<a href="https://books.google.com.au/books/about/TEN_ACRES_ENOUGH.html?id=2eToYTO6quQC&amp;redir_esc=y">https://books.google.com.au/books/about/TEN_ACRES_ENOUGH.html?id=2eToYTO6quQC&amp;redir_esc=y</a>)

The case for smaller, more human scale operations is clear ? though this does depend upon the production system, climate and geography. 

Old farming friends of mine said that a 640 acre block (a square mile section) was of a scale that a man with his family and a team of horses could manage as a mixed cereal/livestock operation here in central Victoria Australia. In the more humid zones of the US that might have been a 1/2 to a 1/3rd for the same operation. 

Our own family farm outside of the city of Bendigo was an example of a smaller holding that was serviced by a reticulated water supply ensuring a higher level of horticultural production to support our town ? a city that for 130 years stayed at about 50,000 people (since the 1970's its grown to be over 100,000). This water supply, meant that the city had a ready supply of producers of a high volume and quality and variety of production. With the advent of road transport, refrigeration and post-cooperative globalisation these smaller holdings (25-100 acres) became hobby farms and are now all being carved up for subdivision into 1-5 acre peri-urban disasters! 

Another piece of influence to me was Peter Kropotkin's, 'Fields, Factories and Workshops' (1890's) in which he painted the case for highly efficient garden agricultures surrounding Paris and did a comparative analysis of British agriculture with that of other parts of Europe at the time. 

George Henderson's amazing trilogy, "The Farming Ladder", "The Farmer's Progress" and "The Farming Manual" are all treasured and oft referred to pieces in my library ? all pertain to smaller scale more efficient agroecologies which are direct in their sales and highly developed in their management. 

Finally, I another piece of influence to me was Arthur Hollins, "The Farmer, The Plow and The Devil" (1986) ? it carries the case again for diversification of smaller scale production systems (read mixed farming!) and direct marketing. <a href="https://shop.fordhallfarm.com/p/The_Farmer_the_Plough_the_Devil/804cf93e2467448385ccf452f3fbdb31/297283d734094369a1b089b270683873/">https://shop.fordhallfarm.com/p/The_Farmer_the_Plough_the_Devil/804cf93e2467448385ccf452f3fbdb31/297283d734094369a1b089b270683873/</a></div></div></div><br/>

If you can get some weather damaged grass hay (untreated) that might help with getting the soil covered on the sides of this structure. 

You might also want to install some rock armour from the end of the road drain to the base of the pond.</div></div></div><br/>

We didn't spend any effort on sealing it or making it big enough based on the actual volume coming down. Since this was the first time I've done something like it I really wanted to see it in action before spending the money to make the pond big. But now, just from the two relatively big storms we've had it's given me the confidence to know it should be much bigger! </div></div></div><br/>

You clearly have some dispersive soils to deal with there. Any gypsum deposits nearby? I'd also get onto that grass hay asap.

You'll need to get the grader back to re-form that edge and have the gypsum ready to cultivate in. I'd apply a band 3 yards wide from the toe of the shoulder up onto the road surface crown. Then cover it with grass hay. 

If you have the water I'd lightly irrigate this zone so that grass will grow ? even if its only annuals its better to get some root anchoring and armour.</div></div></div><br/>

Biggest issues that jumped out to me are:

1. Depth to rock ? especially with regards the dam ? though the free-draining soil description gives me as much concern when looking to have a dam that doesn't need lining.

2. Water supply for horticultural production ? I'd be buying a copy of 'Another Kind of Garden' in order to learn how to do what you want to do with the low water budget you'll be dealing with (<a href="http://www.jean-pain.com/en/jeanpain.php">http://www.jean-pain.com/en/jeanpain.php</a>)

3. The terracing idea seems solid ? any way of slowing water down and putting the rock to positive use would be great

4. E. camaldulensis ? not a great species to be living with. Uses a lot of water and has shallow, spreading and hungry surface roots. Strongly allopathic. I'd strongly consider removing this copse if you are looking to grow anything of value near it.</div></div></div><br/>

That said, steeply sided valleys are not a problem from the perspective of the steep sides, more that that landshape generally suggests that you have soils in the valley with larger particle sizes, whereas more open valley shapes typically have soils with much smaller particle sizes. Whatever the shape we ALWAYS recommend that ANYONE who is doing ANY earthworks does a minimum of geotechnical investigation. At the very least undertaking a Emerson Aggregate Test (<a href="http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/soils/testmethods/eat.pdf">http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/soils/testmethods/eat.pdf</a>).

1. How do these Tesla tiles stack up against the very long lasting Nickel-Iron batteries? We have a few clients who are into durability and low entropy and have gone with NiFe batteries as a result. 
2. Rocket stoves are definitely a great option ? we were all warmed beautifully at #REX6Chile last year (hosted by @grifen and his family) by their fantastic Ianto Evans style unit ? especially great if you're looking at having an integrated solution using smallwood. 
3. You're correct in assuming that we should be able to work this all out in this program. As long as we have the right mapping information its usually very straight forward. 
4. Got it ? that's good as you'll have some positive GST implications potentially as well. Having a 'Primary Producer' status is useful too. Though on the former point you might want to check in with your accountant to see what options you have available to you. 
We had a client a few years back who was, if memory serves me correctly, able to get the GST back on the property purchase as they were able to demonstrate that they were bonefide primary producers in the eyes of ATO.</div></div></div><br/>

Are your siblings interested in being involved with the farm? Will you be creating/have you created a succession plan with your mom &amp; siblings? That will be a big part of the holistic context (or I would say should be, at least) to make sure that the future is laid out clearly to everyone before it becomes an burning question. You mention "a broad skillset" -- if they're interested in getting involved would be good to know more about that (fits into the Decision Makers part of the HC work weeks 2 &amp; 3).</div></div></div><br/>

1. Dams &amp; Water Supply ? we will go through this however it might be a good thing for you to consider determining exactly how much water you actually require. We have developed a spreadsheet model to help with this ? I developed this SS when I consulted to the Tasman EcoVillage years ago. 
2. Consider using a Glockemann pump to fill any high storages from the flowing water you have. 
3. Access ? everyone has a high level layer and this one is Lorinna's! WOW! Sounds like a whole conflict resolution process is required there. 
4. Animal power ? thinking about your location and your whole program made me think that this might be something to consider. Oxen instead of horses perhaps as they don't have as high a pastoral quality needs. 
5. Photos of your firebath please! I've built a few now and we have one on the go right now in the backyard of my mother-in-laws where we live (we're her full-time carers - she's 94)</div></div></div><br/>

Where might I find the spreadsheet you're referring to?2. Glockenspiel, looks like a nice pump and very appropriate, Makes me want to look at the old ram pump laying in the shed that was used when Annie and Bart pumped water from below their property out of Olivers creek.    3. It's quite a saga you could say indeed. There is a fair bit more depth to it then my 'brief' description unfortunately. The access issue has however made Lorinna into what Lorinna is today regarding it's pace of life, the people who left and came, the social dynamics,...      4 Animal Power, It has always been high on my agenda in Belgium and chances are that I would have been moving into horses by now if I had stayed in Belgium, being surrounded there by aging farmers that respected me for my different approach, innovation and respect for them. Together with the understanding for the need to preserve some historical culture and a higher level of resilience. All that made those crusty, stuborn old farmers more open to teaching a young silly bloke like me. I still think I might be able to move to animal and or hybrid power here in Tasmania. I however currently think setting something up using cheap fossil fuel( or read slaves) is of higher priority, right now, in order to perhaps reach to those sort of systems... Oxen,   why not, the thoughts always lean toward horses, good tip. They where used commonly around here and some people still do, cheers for that.  5 firebaths :slightly_smiling_face: nice things indeed. Also handy when you come home from a trip and don't have hot water. Ours is however plumbed in with our house's hot water. In summer we often have a large volume of almost disposaval hot water. Photos just a moment.</div></div></div><br/>

Note the side we're looking at is the burning area which has the standing up flat rock in front of it, that is to be cemented on horizontally  and will make a better draw on the fire and a nicer finish. ( it took me two years of rock digging in the paddocks to find this suitable one :slightly_smiling_face: ) The bath sits on rock supports underneath it rather then on the side walls. Also the 'under-bath-chimney' that goes to the rock chimney at the back is build to avoid the pvc drainage to melt. A few more flat rocks as pavement on one side wouldn't hurt on this bath too. Note the piece of driftwood for the shower head, nice little feature to also hide away the cold and hot water plumbing going to the mixer tap.</div></div></div><br/>

Answers to the Q's: 
1. In the process of developing. Any tips? Apart from the obvious importance of it.
2. traffic? You mean people? too far upstream for that. get the occasional people paddling downstream in canoe. 
3. Water just called to double check: we get 147kL for the house, 6kl/ha allocation at $1.68/kl (12ha = 70kl). and extra kL are $1.7. Also have access to neighbours electric pump to pump from river on 'stock licence'. He will charge me $1/hr to cover elec and maintenance.
4. Native trees - was a run of silky oak, red cedar, qld turpentine, qld maple, white beech (40 total) along boundary fence at highway, with the concept of increasing tree coverage, along a fence so as not to use up usable space, and possible timber harvesting in future years.. planted april 2015 as forest tubes poisened grass, holes with auger, fertilized, tree guards (tall and skinny following Rowan Reid style), on manual drip irrigation in first year. Went great guns. removed irrigation, had the hot dry summer this growing season and lost quite a few, and some of them have stunted since that first year growth. so i'm guessing a whole combination of reasons for their growth.. or lack their of.</div></div></div><br/>

A small comment on your financial: I take it you know that 20-30k doesn't get you very far at all. Be extremely frugal and ask your whys plenty of times before using it. Perhaps choose a small enterprise with the lowest input cost to generate cash flow and if using wwoof power, a decent enough accommodation and cooking setup to make it work. What awesome potential your spot has. Good luck</div></div></div><br/>

Yes, it is a small amount and certainly one of the ?weak links? we must work with?there are of course options for increasing the amount of money available (external work/lending), but the intention is to try and minimise costs so as to break even as far as outgoings are concerned.  But it is not enough to just tick over ? we want to grow ? so ideas are flowing in regards your suggestion to find (several) small enterprises with minimal start costs to get things underway.   To do this, I could keep generating cash flow from external work (I?m a marine scientist by day), but the medium-term vision is to reduce this and begin put energy into building this place up.  The holistic work we have been doing these past two weeks really confirms this.  However, therein lies the catch 22 scenario whereby more cash can be generated with external work, but then that leaves less time being physically present and working on the land.  Am sure many of us are in a similar predicament!  It?s all about finding the right balance :slightly_smiling_face:</div></div></div><br/>

We've just finished reading your longer document and found it absolutely fascinating. We drove from Cradle Mountain to Elizabeth Town in early 2015, passing not far from you and distinctly recall the mountainous terrain. A bit of googling (prompted by your document) has provided quite an insight into the access issues that your community is experiencing and gives an even greater appreciation for what you are doing there. We're in the NSW Hunter Valley and complain about the access issues with getting up to our place which is on an escarpment - you've put it all into perspective now. We look forward to hearing more about your farm, practices and plans as we continue with this course. Cheers, Lisa and Peter</div></div></div><br/>

But being able to see other people's pathways they took is for me too, very valuable. I also feel like I can overload you with a lot of information, perhaps relevant perhaps irrelevant. As I briefly read this yesterday on the road, I thought a story sharing channel on slack might be interesting to have. When you do a pdc course, or a rex course on someone's site, you get a lot more contact with people which you have in a different way online.</div></div></div><br/>

I started farming on my dads' land in Belgium. the local climate and geography are fairly important to understand here. The surrounding area would be considered suburban in Australian standards, with lots of houses, small parcels surrounded by houses and greenhouses, outside production is either very intensive or otherwise used for hobby horses or corn- grass for a few 'large dairies' Land is very hard to come by due to rigid, long term lease protection rules. Very few people would aim to be self sufficient, let alone have a house cow, make hay and all that 'crazy' stuff. My early ventures where very diverse. Very much based around Self sufficiency, biodynamics and approaching the local Demeter standards, I had 2 cows for dairy and calfs for meat and manure for composting, fodder beets and hay for reaching +90% of on farm animal fodder. Also hay for selling, a diverse veg garden, lots of ferments and preserves, different styles of parties at the farm some up to 200 people once. A few local volunteers.  When I had a larger garden then needed for myself, (this is of more practical interest perhaps) pre discovering CSA before the season I sold 'produce vouchers' to friends and interested people and had a visiting day for it. quite successfull. I later repeated this a bit larger here in Lorinna and again sold produce vouchers capped at $5,000 per family, their benefit would be first dibs on produce and a once of 10% interest on their value. It worked fairly well, gathered about $15,000 over about 8 families, ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 some have spend it already others are still going and they have about 10 years to spend it, and I 10 years to start producing. Happy to talk more about this. Anyway back to Belgium's early ventures. After that first pre CSA I discovered CSA in Belgium and I decided I was going to grow the full plot of veg ( about 1.5ha, say about 4 acres) have the cows further away, mostly to not have to work of farm anymore ( It got a bit crazy combining the hobby farm with a 60 hour truck driving job) I also thought I could handle it with an extra person, as my parents had managed that land in veg with the two of them( a bit of 20h work in some peaks here and there, but that was the case for all the neighbours around, so normal I thought) Anyway through the interest in wanting to work the land without chemicals and the access to it I dived in and lots of people came along invested and  got great food in return. I also had kids with learning dificulties at the farm and invalid people, under my guidance and in groups with proffesional guidance, farm visits for schools and governement groups happened regulary, as farmer visits and farmer seed saving collectives, wwoofers where for some time a very important part of the labour. Apprentices through an organic farming school where a great asset and they all now have sucesfull farms. A few times per year I also had visiting days for the members and advertised public open days. Seeds, seedlings, compost and potting mix, where part of the operation. If I would start again, I would probably take it a bit more easy and with even more planning though. If I'd start again and was in need for good cashflow I wouldn't necessarily start and outdoor veg operation, but I do really love so I probably would:) I think something like some an agressive oyster mushroom on straw in a reefer shipping container or microgreens would be a better start if you like it, things that give high kg prices. Anyway the Tassie story has a few more layers and I need to write a novel to tell you all the details. I can say though that being envolved in growing food is such a powerful and nice thing, it's feels very good for me and gives me lots of energy. Good choice on making the dive I think. I hope this made some sense. a bit of stuff really I'm happy to clarify some things if you like.</div></div></div><br/>

This seems to make sense to me, as I feel although legal issues are very permanent and I can see why they are in 'Climate' within the Regrarians platform, I do think that legal issues can actually be changed or circumnavigated, more so than Biospheric climate. 
I am also using this to develop my own well-rounded design process, which is very different to the Regrarians platform considering the scope of my work. I am not a farmer... I would like to be, hence my involvement, but I have started my design process with 'Context' and 'Buildings and Infrastructure (+ existing fences) so I have the base plan and client context to then use the Scale of Permanence to work from as I do first Site A&amp;A and then design. 
Its been really amazing going through all this and seeing where it can fit in my life and my context! Thank you, and I really appreciate the feedback, gives me more to ponder :slightly_smiling_face:</div></div></div><br/>

Your text pasted, my answers in CAPS- thanks for the feedback:  What kind(s) of seedlings did you purchase, why, and at what cost? TIMBER SP. MOSTLY, TO REFOREST, SHADE AND CREATE LONG TERM VALUE, CHEAP ($0.25/EACH).  What might be options for holding those over until next year or a later opportunity when you have a concrete plan in place?  NOT GREAT AS IT WILL REQUIRE A LOT OF EFFORT AND WATER TO KEEP THEM ALIVE THRU THE DRY SEASON AND WOULD HAVE TO REBAG.  I'M NOW THINKING TO COMPROMISE AND PLANT MAYBE HALF BUT JUST ALONG PROPERTY BOUNDARY FENCES, NOT INTERIOR FENCES OR IN PLANTATION FORM TILL I HAVE THE DESIGN.  I COULD THEN IRRIGATE FOR DRY SEASON AT REASONABLE COST   Why do the fences need fixing if no one is living onsite?  PREVENT NEIGHBORS COWS FROM ENTERING AND GENERALLY DEFINING THE BOUNDARIES AS IS CUSTOMARY IN NICARAGUA.   Will a caretaker be able to effectively prevent poaching?  YES.  What would they be living in, as there are no buildings on site?  WOULD BUILD A SMALL SIMPLE HOUSE FOR AROUND $3000.  What was taking place on the site before you bought it a month ago?  ONE FIELD PLANTED IN CORN, SOME CATTLE, FIREWOOD COLLECTION. Can you be onsite yourself frequently enough to deter poachers/trespassing and to get a good feel for the site as you're planning?  YES I LIVE 10 MINUTES AWAY AND GO THERE 3-5 X PER WK.   Regarding illegal hunting -- is this primarily of peccaries for bushmeat, or is there any activity for jaguars and other cats?  NOTHING SO AWESOME UNFORT., MOST OF THAT WAS LOST LONG AGO, THE AREA IS VERY FRAGMENTED, AGRICULTURAL AND HEAVILY HUNTED, (I DID SEE A JAGUARUNDI ABOUT 20KM FROM HERE ONCE SO IT IS POSSIBLE), BUT MOSTLY IGUANAS, BIRDS AND TIMBER POACHING.  Or other important wildlife, such as birds (e.g. a local feather/pet trade?) What are existing populations of wildlife likely to be targeted for hunting? How many cows roam on to your property for grazing? LOW NUMBER- 10-20 cows.   BUT IF FENCES WERE FIXED I COULD CHARGE RENT FOR THEM TO GRAZE.  Are there notable damage patterns you've observed? LITTLE DAMAGE, MAIN ONE IS TRAMPLED BANKS OF RIVER AND STREAM CROSSING. What was/were the mechanism(s) of fence damage - cattle, trespassing, old age, weather, ... ? other?  ALL OF THE ABOVE.  THANKS!!</div></div></div><br/>
