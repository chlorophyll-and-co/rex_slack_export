We finish heritage breed pigs on pasture and organic soy/corn/fishmeal-free feed here in Minnesota.  We're in our third year and finishing 25...

Example if I slaughter 10 pigs 3 whole will cover all fixed costs (processing, feed, feeder pig) for the whole lot. The remaining 7 I sell at Farmers Market by cut. Price range at market is $13-$20 per pound depending on the cut. We have tried for 6 years to sell all our products by whole and half with minimal successes.

They also wrap in paper, as most of our pork is sold at Farmers Market we have found this to be less than optimal, as customers can not "see" the product plus there is the perceived lack of storability. We currently ship out of the area for butchery to Sonoma County Meat Company. Our local abattoir (note they would be  supper irritated to her me use a French word for their SLAUGHTER HOUSE , but I really like woking with this third generation family business) is  20 min from the farm and will kill and transport to Sonoma County Meat Co for us $5/pig.  3 years ago they were shut down by the USDA and this forced us to drive 4.5hrs south to Petaluma for all processing. We have a very fragile system. A local consulting firm ran a study to see if our area could sustain a ne mobil or traditional abattoir and they found that we could not. I will see if I can get a copy of that report to post to the google docs.</div></div></div><br/>

Their equipment was quite impressive, the truck was outfitted with a hydraulic lift, winches, a cold room, hoses, and all the butchery equipment at hand.  What impressed me most however, was the head butcher, who dispatched two bulls, one right next to the other, without any problem.  In fact, the second bull barely noticed when the first one went down.  He did it with a small .243 made of plastic, a laser sight, his broom handle as a monopod, and a steady hand.</div></div></div><br/>

One pipe on a t comes up from the middle and then has two nipples attached to it, about 8" apart. The pipes are attached to the pallet with cable ties.</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-03 16:53</div><div class="msg">this is the third iteration of the system, and has the following benefits over other systems I?ve seen:
 - pallet prevents pigs from spilling extra water and making a wallow
 - can be quickly moved from one paddock ot the next by one person
 - nipples cannot be ripped out (unlike systems that are attached directly to a barrel)
 - can be attached to a barrel or a hose (using low pressure nipples)</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-03 16:54</div><div class="msg">Love that set up. Any issues with hot water building up in the hoses on sunny days and discouraging pigs from drinking?</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-13 20:43</div><div class="msg">I have a tangentially related question on Whole hog prices and quality.  Last week I attended the local livestock auction.  They sold all manner of livestock that is produced mostly by small homestead style operations.  (being new to the area it was weird to watch 6 auction workers and a room full of 150 people spend a few minutes to auction 3 dozen eggs for $0.75 a dozen).  Anyway several 400-600 lb hogs were auctioned.  They all went for &lt;$100.  most in the $0.10 per lb range.  The local processor will butcher it for $25 +$0.25/lb hanging weight and then do value added processing as requested (e.g. Sausage for $0.53/lb).  The lesson to me was that raising pork for the local market is a bad business, the other apparent lesson is this is how our farm should get it's pork.   The downside  that occurs to me is they don't tell you who raised it and how...I tend to equate small operations with better or more humane food but I know that isn't always the case. Any advice or other downside I'm missing?  Can you pick a breed or age where the meat, for lack of a better term, is bad? (basically I'm trying to figure out why they went for so little at auction).  Thanks.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-13 21:03</div><div class="msg">The only way for the numbers to work is to bypass the middlemen throughout the entire value chain including processors, shippers, and wholesellers/grocers to sell direct to the end customer. This sort of auction is marginal at best, you have to do massive volumes to profit on 10 cent per pound prices, and most of these farmers are one problem from bankruptcy.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-13 21:23</div><div class="msg">Agreed.  The price was so low that I was actually turning things around to conclude that I couldn't raise and sell hogs into that market, but maybe my family should eat pork from that market.  So I was hoping some folks in the pig business would tell me any pitfalls in doing this.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-13 21:51</div><div class="msg">At those numbers, the pig farmer is getting under 10% of the retail price. Odds are those numbers mean a guaranteed loss unless if the feed was free (and even then it would at best be a break-even sale).</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-16 17:03</div><div class="msg">I feel that you should consider buying directly from a local small farm who has very excellent practices.  You'll get a better price buying direct, and you will have healthier food, if this is the route you decide to go.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-19 05:21</div><div class="msg">For the majority of farmers/ranchers that I know, the auction barn is a last resort. They know they?ll take a loss - but it?s a smaller loss than not being able to sell the animal at all. Hard to know what the farming practices are from the auction block too.</div></div></div><br/>
