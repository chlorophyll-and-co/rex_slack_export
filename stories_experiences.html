I will take this opportunity, on a very rare kid free, rainy afternoon to start off and share our story, although we're only just begining and our farm is in it's very early stages... 
Our journey with regenerative agriculture stared a about 2 years ago, when we purchased our little piece of paradise in Buxton, Victoria - Australia. Hubby, Tim, &amp; I have both come from conventional farming farmilies (beef &amp; dairy) and my family farm is just up the road from our block. To this point our challenges have been focused around farm succession. 
2 years ago plans began developing which involved Tim &amp; I returning to take over my home farm - my lifelong dream.... The farm has already begun going through a very messy succession, neither my Dad nor my Uncle want to be on the farm long term and my 92 year old Grandfather, although greatly wants Tim &amp; I to be there, is keeping his head well buried in the sand, as it all seems too hard and no one seems to be happy. This prompted the decision by Tim &amp; I that, at least for now, we should just puchase our own place and do our own thing - and stay as far out of the politics as we can. So that's what we did. We purchsed 90 acers of river flats and undulating country on the Steavenson River and lease the farm next door, giving us approximately 140 acres in total. Around the same time, our local food hub held a screening of Polyfaces at the local Cinema - and the since then its been a whirlwind of farmtours, workshops and youtube videos! 
We still live 2 hours away from our farm, in West Gippsland (where our current business is based), and will need to build a house and secure income before we can move there. My Grandfather has just this week, put forward an offer for us to manage the home farm and his lease farm (totalling 1200 acres) which will cover our income, however is farmed very conventionally and I am reasonably confident will be for the rest of his lifetime. This obviously doesn't sit well with us (and our newly developed context!) but i feel being in there and being apart of the farm regardless, may be the best option for me to secure it down the track.... I feel a little like I am selling my soul - but the truth is that home farm is my heart and soul. Anyway, we will see what the future holds and in the meantime we have our little block, full of endless potential, where we can do things our way and continue to learn and grow.  
We currently breed &amp; raise pastured beef &amp; lamb but are still selling into the markets. Eventually we want to do mixed species pastured meats, eggs &amp; honey - selling direct, ideally in a CSA model  (we are super interested in hearing how people work theirs). We have ideas for an on farm cafe/restaurant, perhaps a berry farm? Our location is superb for an agritourism venture - on the only road in from Melbourne, with heavy tourist traffic at peak times and located right next door to the  well known and very popular Buxton Trout Farm. And to top if off spectacular mountain views. We have endless possibilities swirling in our heads! 
My huge passion is local, ethical food production (particually pastured meats) and would one day love to have a mobile or onsite micro abattoir and butchery for processing. Even further, one day I would love to be able to provide wild caught game species to conscious consumers as well - I will continue to dream! 
Our biggest weakest link currently, besides the distance, seems to be a lack of belief in ourselves, and lacking the courage to bite the butllet and just dive in! It doesn't matter how many inspiring, successful people encourage us, nobody can actually push us over the edge, except us :joy:
I am really enjoying reading everyones stories, it's such a fantastic platform for sharing :blush:</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-19 07:53</div><div class="msg">@regrarians commented on @kyliewilson?s file <a href="https://regrarians.slack.com/files/kyliewilson/F6BMNFMCP/fb_img_1463377237326.jpg">https://regrarians.slack.com/files/kyliewilson/F6BMNFMCP/fb_img_1463377237326.jpg</a>: Brilliant to read ? bloody succession sucks doesn't it ? this story is not unlike my own and our land has been out of our family for nearly 20 years as a result. I was you in our case @kyliewilson. 

Lisa and I ran the 'Fields of Farmers' series (at a financial loss to us) a few years ago with Joel, Daniel and Sheri Salatin around Australia. We lost around $15K on that tour however were able to reconcile it with other projects we had going on. Nonetheless we ran it because we have this thing about others not going through pain unnecessarily. 

In any case your story is great and we think it would be great if you were able to have the beneficiaries of your Grandfather's estate spell out what's next. For them to be clear now as you are looking to invest heavily all kinds of capital and they owe it to you and your family to be clear and clear now. 

When we lost our land I said to my mother (who with 2 of her brothers) were complicit in the sale away from me, that now I had some sense of indigenous people's loss ? even though our's was 'only' 5 generations of loss not 100's or 1000's of generations by comparison. 

When I was interviewed by a US-based organisation last week who are looking to create a 'Certified Regenerative' program I said that one of the measures of true regeneration is when families stay on their land from one generation to the next whilst that land continues to have continuously improving ecosystem processes as a result. 

Our own view is that production agricultural landscapes should ideally not be valued based on their real estate value, but rather on their agricultural value ? this is happening in some places and some would see this as being market socialism. That's all fine except where the destiny otherwise is a return to baronial feudalism ? the very system that our pre-colonial ancestors sought to escape in the 'new world'. 

Here's to you having your generation and that of your children and beyond getting well past all of that and that the landscapes under your management flourish and continue so in your loving hands...</div></div></div><br/>
