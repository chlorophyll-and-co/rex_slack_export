The White Tailed Deer was introduced in 1996 by the US Navy for hunting (US military occupied the Island and did military practices from 1902 to 1975), and they have taken over. Since I am not currently living in Culebra I have started with the planting of fruit trees, and I soon discovered deers loved most of them. Since then I have needed to protect most trees with 1-meter wide x 6 feet tall chicken wire. Although it has worked I consider it a short term and temporary solution since chicken wire is expensive and managing the flimsy chicken wire am using is tedious (sloping hand, hand weeding, etc). Three questions: (1) What could be the fencing solution for this deer problem (6 acres)? (2) What other solutions do you recommend (a friend from Maine recommended spraying a castor oil emulsion, and I have seen other spraying alternatives but haven't really tried one yet)? (3) Considering Allan Savory?s work, could a considerable deer population have been positive for the general ecological environment of this small island (7 x 3.5 miles)? I would need to dig in further, but I consider the dry land island of Culebra is much greener now than before. Let me know if I should put some of these questions in another channel. Thank you.</div></div></div><br/>

Because of a lack of predators and restrictions on hunting, they can be a huge pressure on growing much of anything.  I also use what I call cages.  The cages for deer protection I build are from 2"x4" welded wire that is 5' tall and are usually around 3.5' to 5' in diameter.  I use at least 3 tee posts, 2"+ bamboo canes, or rebar to keep the cages in place with wire ties.   I have a set of 50 of them that I use for establishing sets of trees.  The cages are only needed for the first couple years but will last for much longer than that so they can get multiple years of use.  I leave the cages around the trees until the trees are tall enough that the browse height is below most of the canopy.  On single trunk type trees we will use a much smaller cage to protect trees with a caliper less than 3" from antler rub damage.</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-10 12:03</div><div class="msg">@ Great thank you! It looks like a conversation has begun regarding a deer population above. Does your experience in the past with heavy deer populations as well as a heavy Jack Rabbit populations see success with the Kiwitech electric fence around a large area for young fruit trees and crops or is more individual fencing cages and or a permanent fence of 8ft or higher the better option? As of now we have no fencing set up anywhere on the property and the cost is daunting to us at the moment. Thanks!</div></div></div><br/>

I second @ on the individual tree fencing strategy, it has worked for us here in california although we have a different type of deer.  Consider putting a layer of cardboard around your trees inside of whatever fencing or cages you use to protect them from a few inches away from the trunk to just outside the drip line of the young trees.  The light exclusion will give you at least four weeks of weed free growth depending on what time of year and how humid your environment is.  I lived and worked for many years in Central America and can definitely say that cardboard around trees will both buy you time and eventually feed the soil.  some don't like to use post consumer goods on their land, but in the race against "el monte" sometimes one must compromise.  best of luck!!</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-12 19:36</div><div class="msg">@ thank you for your help. At this time I have a large file which I located all the different fruit trees and bushes that are zoned for my area that I have interest in(apple, fig, pawpaw, mayhaw, mulberry, orange, lemon, persimmon, pear, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grapes) and most need at least 2 for pollination to be achieved. They all tell me that each tree basically requires about 15-20ft so if I break down an acre I believe is 208ft i could possibly fit 10 trees divide by the 2 needed for each type and i am left with 5 types and 10 trees planted every 20ft.  But because I am without any  past experience with them I am apprehensive to plant so many at this time. I really wanted to try my hand at the guild method with maybe a mayhaw? We are on 19 acres so we will certainly in the future planting a fruit tree orchard, hugelkulture beds on 5acres, pastured egg production, 2 goats, and some agroforestry since we have so much forest already.  So in the future we will be planting more than 1 acre so that is why I wondered if the electric fence would work to help for now so we aren't burdened with permanent fencing the entire property or an area that we will expand upon in the near future. What are your thoughts?</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-13 00:42</div><div class="msg">Thanks @ and @ ? the first thing I would do is to create an inventory of all of the species that you have and then establish their various uses. That will include looking at their durability (in and above ground), timber/lumber qualities both in the round and dimensioned, firewood etc. When you do that then you can look to measure the individuals and start to target them for their ultimate end uses. Some are going to be ready to go now for fencing and it may be part of your silvicultural management.

Otherwise the best preservation treatment is to start with a species that's already known to be durable. If that's not the case then charring is the easiest method ? then you are talking other nastier treatments such as creosote and CCA etc.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-13 01:13</div><div class="msg">@ - Living fences is a great idea for using your native species. Especially in your sub-tropical area it should be possible to identify suitable species that you can propagate as fairly mature trees to get fences started. This avoids treatments and gives you a much lower maintenance fence. The living fence posts can then be managed as coppice. This has been the best solution I have arrived at for my property.</div></div></div><br/>

Internally they use 2-3 hot wires running around 6KV ? with the 3 wire subdivision fences the central wire is an earth return. 

See slide 23 of the #7.Fencing REX Presentation for a couple of photos of their set up.

Otherwise its a matter of comparing the cost of roo grazing and dog damage to that of a fence. 

The Clipex feral fencing system is a bit of a game-changer cost-wise in this space ? that said I worked with a grazier out of Toowoomba (Queensland AU) a few years back and he set up a Waratah based feral fence and he'd worked out it had a 5 year ROI (from memory) so scale and the sum forage consumed and cost of stock losses will be need to be quantified into any modelling. 

We've installed an 1800mm high fence around our place and its had an enormous impact. It cost about $12K with our labour not included for about 1.3km. We have yet to put the gates but its clear the roos haven't got a chance.</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-06 20:32</div><div class="msg">Thanks @ ? I'd heard about #Clipex® from a client when it came out and I dissed it because it was made in China etc. That was probably 8 years ago or so. 

Then they were getting some traction in the market and I thought I'd give it a run. However by that stage we'd already invested in some custom prefabricated wire made by Frauenfelder in Albury (NSW, AU) and I was going to run with clipex star pickets (the rest of the world's T posts for our USA friends). But then I found that the horizontals on my Frauenfelder wire didn't match up with the slot spacing on the Clipex posts. 

So I ended up going with Australian made 2.4m Waratah Jio® Star and Jio Maxi posts at 6m spacings with a Maxi every 6th post. The Jio clips, whilst not as fast as the Clipex slot system, is a vast improvement on the tie wire system you use with their Galstar® posts. 

With that we only ended up using the Clipex 3m 100XL Stayfast end assemblies as these are the only prefabricated (steel) end assemblies we could find for that height fence. 

So from the ground up:

0mm - graded and bladed to mineral soil surface (2m wide)
50mm - Waratah 2.5mm Longlife® High Tensile Barb
50-1850mm - Frauenfelder 1.8m prefabricated wire (17 horizontals)
1400mm - Waratah 2.5mm Longlife® High Tensile 

We used a Strainrite 1900mm wire netting clamp to tension the prefabricated wire. 

As I used this opportunity to teach our son how to fence we used a normal star picket driver for half of the fence and then went to the Christie 4 stroke (Honda) post driver. Similarly 3/4 of the fence used hand tied knots (normal post tie off and figure :sunglasses: and the rest we used Gripples® and Gripple T's for the post tie offs.</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-16 00:32</div><div class="msg">Thanks @ ? I've not had a lot of experience with the management of chilean needle grass. 

If needle grass (Nassella neesiana), or other lower successional perennial species such as African Love Grass (Eragrostis curvula) are a component of a grassland then I'm not too worried. Its when they become dominant, which I'm sure is your concern, that we seek to apply the control levers. 

Its also about understanding why in a well functioning grassland does the opportunity arise for the dominance of any particular species, be it needle grass, love grass, Phalaris aquatica ('Harding Grass' in north America), or ryegrass (Lolium sp.) for that matter. 

The Nasellas sp. are similar in some ways to our native Stipa sp. in that they are palatable when the leaf to stem ratio is favouring leaf however this reduces significantly thereafter. Therefore its important to try and graze when its leafy and palatable and maybe hold on in there for a little longer than you would otherwise. Not so much that the livestock start to consume the surface litter, but until their dung and gut fill scores suggest that their nutritional needs are not being met. 

I'd be observing recoveries to see which duration of grazing periods are favouring any and all species such that you aren't making the needle grass a 'bogey-grass'. 

@ would no doubt suggest setting up some practice areas as would I. 

With regards the pigs ? I think its always wise to look to have relatively frequent moves with pigs such that there is very much a mosaic of disturbance and no more than that ? unless of course you're using them to set up a market garden or otherwise. 

I think with pigs too that the nutrient loading that they (and other omnivores) add to a system, by way of imported feed, requires some 'mopping up' of that nutrient in order to not waste either the opportunity it presents nor the imbalances that might otherwise favour some species over others. The best solution is to sow a heavy feeding mixed species cover crop which could then be strip grazed or stockpiled as a standing forage. This would help to march grassland succession along in favour of species other than needle grass etc.</div></div></div><br/>
