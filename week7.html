<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-13 23:25</div><div class="msg">Thanks @ and @ The question originated in thinking about a perennial grass species I have on my property that I've noticed my flock tends to not go after and then it evolved into what I posted. There's a Nature Conservancy area nearby that has been taken over by Johnson grass. Looks like I was mistaken about it being unpalatable, but I did read that it can cause bloat and can contain sufficient amounts of hydrogen cyanide which could kill livestock if eaten in quantity. Anyway, the Nature Conservancy manages the grass through repeated mowing, but to me that seems like it wouldn't necessarily actually move the landscape towards a more native grassland landscape. Mute question, I suppose, since the grass can be eaten. </div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-14 00:04</div><div class="msg">Hi @ so you saying you dont dig holes for soil testing or VSA test anymore. BTW your equipment list in your handbook doesnt include a shovel or hand trowel. Therefor im trying to get a clearer vision on how you determine soil types and conditions. Using plant or 'weed' indicators for soil types and mineral deficiency's would be the alternative method, is that correct? if so have you got more information on that?</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-14 00:28</div><div class="msg">Thanks, you for the answer @ @. I've been recently integrating perennial peanut as a ground cover from some fruit trees, but I've been also mulching heavily. Do this strategies compete? Answering your doubt, PR climate is humid tropical, but Culebra Island is dry tropical brittle environment. In the future, I would like to integrate goats and/or sheep?s to manage the areas between fruit trees, but my guess was that it would be ideal once the fruit trees are grown (and also once I am able to live consistently on the farm). Couple of questions: How does one control the damage the goats can do the fruit trees while grazing? What more or less could the goat carrying capacity be and what would the goat management possibly look like in this diversified fruit tree and perennial plant 6-acre farm context? I included a photo of the whole watershed of the farm (with another question) in the water channel and tagged regrarians. This may give you an idea. What other insights could you give me of animal integration in this situation? Would be cool if you could answer on week 7 Q &amp; A. Best.</div></div></div><br/>

I neglected to make mention of this week's task work and I had to run off for an appointment with our son that he'd scheduled. 

"Undertake a site analysis using the assessment techniques that we provide in the webinar. "

The main focus that @ and I have for this week is to have you understand the following:

1. The landscape function analysis methods that Graeme put forward 
2. The Bullseye method as an alternative/addition to Graeme's table

Along with: 

3. Thinking first about how deep a site analysis you need to do for where you and your enterprise (s) are at right now. 
4. Review the site analysis materials that you have already assembled i.e. soil tests, cores and pits; vegetation surveys, zone and sector analysis. 
5. Using the Site Analysis sub-chapter of the 2. Geography chapter to guide you on what you need to analyse on your site. 

Thanks for your patience,

Darren</div></div></div><br/>

I think I remember Kirk Gadzia talking about adding seeds to a system in concert with rotational grazing, so that the animal impact and manure drove the seeds into the ground and gave them something to use to start growing. Also, we have the advantage in Australia of clean, native grass seed generally being available in different areas. Interested to hear what @ and @ have to say too</div></div></div><br/>

My question was mainly in the context of the week 7 lecture.  It was stated a couple times in the webinar that decomposition was key to building good soil and soil life.  I'd been told that decomposition won't happen efficiently in pasture if the soil PH is too low.  This statement was made by Ag college folks (University of Missouri) who then follow it with proscribed liming, fertilizing and weed killing.  So I was looking for some comment on this statement.   If this were true the follow on question is a chicken and egg question.  Do you pay to lime the field and raise the PH or do you just depend on grazing a marginal field with the idea that manure will fertilize and what incremental organic matter the grazing adds will start to buffer the PH raising the PH in concert with slow OM growth.</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-15 02:52</div><div class="msg">Being relatively extensive @ I think that a shift to holistic planned grazing would be the best way to go. Native grass seed is very expensive ($4-500+/kg) and establishing them before your site and management is ready has the potential to be very costly indeed. 

Its likely that there will be remnants here and there, particularly on the edges and roadsides/public land and so even though the previous management of constant cultivation and pre-emergent/selective herbicides etc. has gone on you would over time get some recruitment. 

The other thing to consider is undertaking a pasture/cover cropping program. This would accelerate the development of soil carbon, something that the better quality perennial native grasses require to establish. Its quite clear that the era that we've been through post-settlement has been very successful at reducing soil carbon levels and with that many of the pastures in SE Australia have shifted to winter-active annuals. 

Keen to hear what @ has to say as well.</div></div></div><br/>

Time to get back to perennials and natives can be a bit long. Putting in a practice area is a good first step. The Mosley's use a pasture cropping technique, at Cobar, to regenerate large areas  Darren and Dan's advice is good and Gabe Brown recommends priming soil with a multi species cover  . We have been getting people to try a few of the 'african subtropicals' eg's green panic, premier digit as they are cheaper and have been chosen for germiantion and establishment and then allow natives to increase or even broadcast. Depends a bit on cost, time and risk that suits you. Happy to discuss further, send photos etc if you wanted to email or call</div></div></div><br/>

A lot of work to get the other layers in order as well (especially water). To have a "HEAVY" impact with holistic planned grazing should we introduce cattle into our program? As we are only running sheep at the moment.                            There is a bit of native grass around the boundary but mainly speargrass. Would be keen to try some some of the 'Africa subtropics' as an option to get something useful growing in the short term over the summer. Would you put a perennial rye in to get some cover over winter or are there better species?

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-08-16 01:06</div><div class="msg">@ One other option that might be interesting would be to get some native grasses as plugs or tubestock and make a fenced area for them near your house. No access for rabbits, sheep, etc. Over time these will produce seed that will naturally blow around into the larger landscape or that you could collect and distribute on your walks of the property.</div></div></div><br/>

There's a narrow window to get them off once they're digging, but for rhizomatous grasses (at that farm a lot of "couch" or quackgrass), it was ideal to let the pigs do a bit of ripping &amp; digging up, then move them off before they'd compacted any one area. Feeding a lot of squash discards, whey, and various fruit/veggie crops in addition to on-farm grains created huge inputs, and even netted a few free squash crops in some spots that we didn't return them to. They did seem to love rooting right along the electric lines, so putting those lines on a keyline or contour pattern may have been a good way to kickstart some further work down the road. I'm meeting more &amp; more people using the NZ kune kunes, which were bred as a grazing, i.e. non-rooting, breed, and seem to get good results. Guner Tautrim at Orella Ranch (site of the first REX10 in southern CA last year) could comment on their integration with pasture. Also Paul Grieves at Primal Pastures.</div></div></div><br/>

What are the variables you are adjusting?" @ From @ - Checking for good litter, put the animals in, and want to be pushing the litter onto the soil surface, clearing growth points of perennial grasses. If you get light grazes all the time, you start to lose the better perennial grasses, so you need to intensify impact. Monitor animals' gut fill, manure and dung scores so we know there's a nice match between feed available and what's happening in the rumen. Make sure we're getting animal performance. Lots of pieces to manage, observe and focus on what's going on at different times of the year.</div></div></div><br/>

Two things come to mind ? one is to consider, as @ suggested, sowing a succession of fall sown and spring sown mixed species cover crops. If you dropped the forage that you have now with a flail mower or were able to do some testing with some livestock then that would get it in a ready state for some sowing this fall. 

Second, some aeration - using a non-inversion subsoiler will help with releasing (outgassing) some of the Hydrogen ions which are dropping the pH. The late Pat Coleby wrote an article 20 years ago about the 'liming effect' that subsoiling can have.</div></div></div><br/>

My hair sheep really like the ragweed and whatever the plant is with the yellow flowers, but they only nibble at the plant with white flowers (it is so prominent I should be able to figure out what it is, but so far I haven't been able to match it up in weed guides).  Unfortunately my 22 sheep aren't enough to get the needed animal impact</div></div></div><br/>

I've read that ragweeed makes good winter stockpile so right now I'm planning on adding a handful of cattle and trying to use weeds as winter stockpile for the sheep and cattle.  That is interesting on sub-soiling changing the PH, I hadn't heard that before.  I'll try to find that reference; I do have a sub-soiler that is kind of an "on the cheap" sub-soiler I was planning to try a practice sub-soil line this week to see what happens, it doesn't have a  hardened shoe or tooth so it may not work well....<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3jc4wytNtKbTkhrbzZ3QjVIS0k">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3jc4wytNtKbTkhrbzZ3QjVIS0k</a></div></div></div><br/>
