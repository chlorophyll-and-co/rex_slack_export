As Week 1 draws to a close, we're really interested in getting everyone perspectives on their introduction to the REX Online. 

We don't need an essay, more a paragraph or two of your experiences, whether your expectations were met or exceeded, any improvements you'd suggest, etc. 

Please only write what you're comfortable with us sharing publicly.

It's just a feedback:

Be clear about the Team registration. The whole team needs to get access to all info right away otherwise there is confusion and additional work for participants/organizers later on (forwarding emails, adding accounts, etc.)

Try to put all basic information about the usage of different platforms (Slack, Drive, REXaccount) in one mail. This one email needs to have clear instructions on how to use the platforms and what they are going to be used for and what type of material is in a certain platform!

Trying to keep certain information in one platform would help. I was really confused where to find instructions, materials, links etc., because they were all over the place at first.

There was overwhelming amount of emails coming in.</div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-07 12:11</div><div class="msg">Hello all. My two cents: First I would like to acknowledge the amount of work the REX team have put into this and that it is perfectly understandable the glitches that come with the fact that you are trying a new (and very important) media. Along with the comments from @, that will surely be delt with, this beginning of course made feel like If I was placed in a field day with a group and everyone went of their own way, naturally seeking their subject of choice. That, per se, is not a problem because I kept with the host that guided the tour, but I can´t stop the feeling that I am missing something important that is going on by the chicks, or the electric fence. Maybe if the folders were created as needed (week 1, 1climate, etc) people would keep together, or maybe that is the whole point of the platform and I´ll just have to keep up with the different conversation (the Slack limit of a fixed amount of messages is a problem here), and that is OK too. Just pointing out a feeling so that the REX team can discuss if that is something good, bad, or indifferent. Thanks and congratulations for this feedback space. Regards.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-07 12:18</div><div class="msg">pywong: Thank you for the feedback @! The intention behind the course was that people put in as much time as they choose. The time you put in turn  largely determines how much you get out of the program. As you know, you will put in many more hours of study throughout your involvement with your land, whether in this program or elsewhere. 

It helps if you do not think of it as a course. I think about this program as  a lifelong community founded upon the pursuit of knowledge and mutual improvement through feedback and critique.</div></div></div><br/>

First, thank you REX Team for everything you've done individually and as a team to eventually assist us in our journey today. I am very grateful for that. Am also very grateful for the quality of answers I get from you. It is amazingly easy to understand your points. Of course I had, like most of us, a couple of misunderstandings using Slack for the first time, but hey, this is community dynamics and healthy communities should be self-organized... I entered this REX online with a bit of fear and unsure whether it was for me. Now I am 100% sure I will find what we are looking for within the coming weeks working with you REX Team and the lucky hundred as well. Thanks to all and glad to learn from you all.</div></div></div><br/>

I think my biggest issue has been getting across all the tech/apps platforms that I'm not used to. I think I probably would have been more across this week if I could already navigate my way through these. I also find that 7-9 is not the best time for me to do webinars as we have young kids, a farm, staff etc. but am also aware that someone will be inconvenienced no matter the time. Now I have got used to slack I do like a learning platform where I can access and continue my learning whilst in the field, so to speak. </div></div></div><br/>

<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-07 14:35</div><div class="msg">The introduction (week1) has been largely successful in getting us excited about the Regrarians platform.  But I get the feeling that some people might be left out right now.  Hopefully it is just because they are busy. 

My recommendation for future REX would be to attempt more structure and organization (longer list of easy homework assignments) for the first couple weeks.  Thereby gently prodding more of us into engagement in the beginning, so that we can all get more out of this course.  After the first couple weeks most people will likely get with the program regardless of how things started.

I understand that there are always some difficulties with starting new things.  All in all things seem to be going well.  Contrary to my first impressions, Slack has been a good and useful app.  While more advanced functions, such as detailed notifications would be nice; Slack certainly takes my vote above FB.</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-07 14:50</div><div class="msg">I'm wondering how many people have submitted task work, as I can't see that many folders of participants in the week 1 folder, I'm guessing they are not visible to me. I personally got sidetracked often by reading through slack and going back to the google drive. And initially was also on the wrong track with filling in the checklist as I think I found that in the week 1 chapter. It was helpful being able to see a few other taskworks from other participants. I've also started writing almost a novel on how each layer is being applied on our property. Is anybody having that issue too. Well perhaps not really an issue, possibly a helpfull documet further down the course, but it sure takes time.</div></div></div><br/>

We have limited experience in many enterprises that we are planning to accomplish and brand new to the property we are going to set up these enterprises on so we are really relying on learning from others and their valuable feedback to help guide us. It is a bit overwhelming coming to this course with no working knowledge of the platform and we were wondering if there are others with similar experience and feelings. In any case we are grateful for this opportunity and want to make the very best of this investment in our community and the planets future!</div></div></div><br/>
<div><img src="" /><div class="message"><div class="username"></div><div class="time">2017-07-07 16:37</div><div class="msg">brown.loren.w: Thank you for this feedback. 

We learned many things from this initial launch, particularly in preparing an organized framework that facilitates greater clarity in regards to where files are stored and how weekly tasks are distributed and managed.

Additionally, taking time to familiarize people with Slack in advance is clearly important. It is a fairly advanced application and the notification system is not bad but it is fairly hidden, like many other functions. This is something we are looking into so that it is dealt with for the duration of this current program as well as for the future.</div></div></div><br/>

That said we did use the orientation session and the first #Live1 to orient people ? something I think you may have missed @ . 

I certainly try to keep people informed however sometimes that might border on over-informing and so a lot of emails and preparations went in. 

The weeks to follow will be a lot smoother ? sometimes being left in the field by yourself and yelling out ?hey I?m over here? actually works too. No-one has got completely loss and the community of service is very alive here which is great. Thanks @</div></div></div><br/>

Might improve: to have a more clear sequence for the learning process --&gt; there may be more suitable platforms out there that allow for a easier/ clearer organization, but this is good enough to go; got a bit confused with all questions ahead of time, loosing a bit the focus on the RPP. On the other hand, it is more efficient time-wise as participants have different needs and this way the "empty space" typical from the initial stage of learning is filled with questions, making room for later.</div></div></div><br/>

As I mentioned in another reply to you in this <#C65AC784D|week1feedback> channel, this 10 week REX program doesn't follow the Regrarians Platform (RP) as does our 10 day onsite REX or would the 44 week online program when we eventually run that (hopefully 2018!).

However we did use the first webinar to look at the RP in its application to farm planning and indeed this program. I don't think I have any recordings of any of my onsite REX RP layer presentations online or even recorded, so I'm not going to be much help there either. 

Best thing I can offer is that you look at the individual REX 10 day presentations  (static in keypoint and powerpoint formats)  in the 'Regrarians® Platform Resources' catalog under '13.

I'm calling it a program as it fits in with our tried and true 'Works Pattern' ? a Land Planning Process we've used since the mid 90's (see link below).

So I would again refer to the points I made in your other questions around the rationale behind the order here. 

I found signficant limitations with the 10 day REX model when it came to giving the right amount of priority to the consultancy side of that program. It was 50:50 training:consultancy and the consultancy side was limited in its efficacy for the host. 

This 10 week model is 20:80 training:consultancy and with slack time/review time perhaps more like 5:95. 

That being the case we need people to understand that they have a project to focus on and to trust that the process we're basing this program upon is worth following.

How are we supposed to develop a full farm plan if we don't cover the platform layers in depth?  Wouldn't it make more sense to get everyone on the same page about something like access *then* start asking questions to dive deeper in slack? Some folks seem very familiar with the platform layers and then others are completely new to them...</div></div></div><br/>

Its a interesting proposition that you put forward and what I've established over the years is that there are two ways you can go about running the open consultancy model:

1. You can lead people through an whole program where you give them every insight and technique and then let people then work out for themselves which of these to apply to each layer to a plan ? that's been broadly the way our 3 day ROC &amp; 10 day REX open consultancies would run. 

2. You can lead people through a whole process that resembles the reality of a consulting job and together develop a plan for the way forward. 

When we've run the former model I've repeatedly witnessed plans that are a bit cookie cutter in their range of techniques and in many cases focus too much on development and not enough on management. 

The latter model has typically resulted in a more management focussed planning outcome, and one that is a lot leaner and reflective of the what's appropriate than the former. 

This 10 week program doesn't have the luxury of time to allocate to a week per Regrarians Platform layer ? if it did then we'd not spend anywhere near enough time concentrating on the things that I think really matter as people transition from where they are now to where they want to go. 

The point about 'developing a full farm plan' is an interesting one too. If I'm a permaculturalist or a keyliner (or dare I say someone trained in 'restoration agriculture') then I'll have a very different 'full farm plan' to what someone who is a holistic management follower would develop. The former would have a development-focussed plan, whereas the latter would likely hav a management-focussed plan. 

With this 10 week REX program I thought the program outline makes it pretty clear that we're looking to strike a balance ? though that you have to spend the time in holistic context development to determine what is best for you and your project.</div></div></div><br/>

I do very much see the value of both systems, as Dayna and Darren have outlined.  I as a beginner in large scale farm design, wanted some cookie cutter solutions, or recipes as we say in the kitchen.  It seems to me, that we haven't gotten to that part yet.  We are literally in the depths and heights of Holistic Context which is, well, huge.  I have seen courses, where this part is rushed, and then a lot of time is lost in the planning process, because people spend time on designing elements that don't fit there context.  So, at this point, a stitch in time saves nine.  In fact, I am amazed that two sessions were taken for the topic.  Not just because that shows us how important it is, but also because it doesn't just tell us, it shows us why and how, and makes us clear our minds a bit, compost some of the rubbish we have in our minds, to create fertile soil for the seeds we are about to plant.  Limiting beliefs will abound, and can drowned out an endeavor, as we all know.               BUT, I also think we are going to have our cake and eat it too.  After we Finnish this section, and as people begin to plan and go through the layers of their plans, we will have full support on slack, from the regrarians team, and fellow participants.  As we jump into our own designs, we will come up with the concrete equations to ask on slack and get those answers. And as others complete their work we will be able to benchmark and learn from dozens upon dozens of land, design and comments.  Just as we have this week, looking at each others holistic contexts,and I loved @ 's daily statement of purpose, by the way. It's little like when the roller coaster is still being pulled up that first hill...</div></div></div><br/>

The ability of each student to go off on their own path, yet do so in a community of like minded people, and with the support of the Regrarians team to help find answers and solutions to questions and problems is incredibly powerful.   Now that we are all started and going, I really look forward to the next 4 weeks, which should be phenomenally productive, and instructive as we see how each person develops their project and resolves their issues using their Holistic Context.</div></div></div><br/>

I'm a bit slow on the uptake sometimes...

The Keyline Scale of Permanence (KSOP) and Holistic Management (HM) were sitting there in front of me for the better part of 15 years before I saw their value in our scheme of things.

Similarly I've been designing trainings around the Regrarians Platform (after the KSOP) since 2010 and developed 'Our Works Pattern' (OWP) in 1996-7 ? it wasn't until developing this REX program that I saw it value as something to follow in a training...

I wonder what we've also missed or overlooked in terms of processes and methodologies ? to be revealed no doubt! :wink:</div></div></div><br/>
