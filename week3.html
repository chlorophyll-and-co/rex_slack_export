I am a bit slow but I am starting to get it. Reinforcing successes makes sense - Piang Yow Wong @pywong 

Success last week was saying ?No, but thank you for thinking of me? to two pieces of work that didn?t fit my context. In the past I?d found it hard to say no or say no without feeling guilty. Now it feels comfortable, focused and exciting to say what work I do want to do. And I showed my enthusiasm for the work that I am doing now that is a good fit. Thank you, Javan - this works! - Tracey Avery @basaltlane 

My daily statement of purpose has made a lot of impact... - Justin Seeley @justin.s 

I could find nothing negative in my context - it just came up with more positives! - Per Staurup @per.staurup 

The context work has given me a platform with my wife to frame our future and what we together want. - Ivan Woodcock @ivanwoodcock78 

Don?t let your goals get in way of your quality of life was a real ?ahha? moment for me - Matt Conroy @eightyfiveacres 

It?s awesome to see clear commincation within the team just by knowing our own individual Quality of Life Context. - Aljaz Plankl @aljaz_plankl 

Huge success for me discovering Holistic Context in this REX workshop. I can now see it?s been the missing piece in my farm project. Thank you! - Sherry Smith @sharrysmith 

I worry a lot -- revisiting my Daily SOP (I am at peace with reality) freed up a ton of mental space to better thinking and acting. - Dayna Burtness Nguyen @dayna.burtness 

In learning about how to master Slack and finding that it can be intuitive and a non-issue...Thank you! Stuart Porteous @stuart_porteous 

From last week I began to see that maybe I shouldn?t continue with the farm...which was fantatsically useful! - Stuart Porteous @stuart_porteous 

Win this week- i really liked the idea of doing a thorough pre-mortem and having a solid frame work for doing that. Dragan Mardesic @dragan 

Maybe just rename the ?Testing Assuming Wrong? to ?Try to Disprove?? It?s the same as the scientific process - scientists doing experiments are actually always trying to DISprove a hypothesis, not prove it. Per Staurup @per.staurup 

My partner and I finally sat down and asked ourselves some hard questions about life and what makes us happy, it was hard, and uncomfortable, and made me feel the opossite of what I thought it would make me feel. we finally faced something that we had been avoiding forever.... - Jennifer Seeley @jenny7 

That the first assumption is usually wrong is an interesting one I wrestle with: I believe real writing is revision, BUT as a musician, I do know that 1st takes are totally different than all the takes after and can often have unique merit or truth to them. - Matt Powers @mattpowers 

Nice comment Matt Powers @mattpowers - I agree that sometimes when I am in the zone i?m not really asking questions, I?m just doing and this is sometimes when I get the most done and it feels the most worthwhile. It?s an interesting contrast to the merit I see in this process we?re going through! - Ella McHenry @ella</div></div></div><br/>

It was a great first step in building a holistic context to filter my daily actions through, and brought acute awareness to my interactions and language, as i considered my words and behaviors and thought about 'did they build trust? or not'.     After a time we changed that SOP to 'We live to understand, love, and respect each other as individuals."  and then after a time we added to it "We live to understand, love, and respect ourselves and each other as individuals."  That's our daily SOP right now, and that, along with a lot of dedicated hard work, some with guidance, and some without, has brought us very far forward.

Certainly it reads to me as a much more effective document than the bylaws themselves do. As such it may well prove to be very useful to the members and the broader community who are seeking to capture what your community is all about.</div></div></div><br/>

One thing I'd look at is how to make it a little tighter in terms of the wording.  Can you make any broader statements that would encapsulate a few others?  Imagine this is a tool that when you have a decision to make, you are going to run it through your SOP, your QOL statements, and see if it will help produce or bring you closer to your FRB.  It is really tough to narrow it down and I think this is an awesome document as is..  I'll share that in my own experience, months into this I am still figuring out ways of pruning mine down.  The more I do the more effective of a tool it becomes, mainly because I am less resistant to using it.  Certainly for a big decision you'll be willing to sit down and take the time to run through this all.  But when it comes to a smaller day to day decision, or a decision you need to make quickly, will you still run through the process?  

You very well may, and that is just my thoughts.  Great work and I think the ever evolving dream you shared is fantastic.</div></div></div><br/>

Now for the tough love portion. If this is whole is the farms, then the dasop is for the farm as well, it seems it's currently for you. While I love the colour scheme, it's very hard to read. Consider changing the colour for quick reference. This is a working document and I find functional beauty is necessary. I'm confused to what all the text below QOLS is. Can you clarify what each element is or label it directly. Overall this is an exceptional first start. Now is the time to PRUNE PRUNE PRUNE. What's essential? What's the single malt serving of your context? The nitty gritty? If you were forced on the spot to rewrite the context what would stick. Once you test with questions and spot check you'll be thanking your past self for making it simple. Well done.!</div></div></div><br/>

Yes, it is taking a long time to get answers to our testing questions!

Should we build a substantially better seed raising area. Q1, Does it address a problem- A. Yes. We raise poor seedlings compared to the ones we buy in. We drive 2 1/2 hours each way once a month to collect the seedlings and they are a good price but it?s an annual outlay of around $10-$12K. The area we currently use is exposed to wind, has inadequate space, labour intensive to irrigate, wildly erratic in climatic conditions. Q2-Does it address a weak link? A. Financial? Yes. We?ll save a significant outlay, Biological? Yes, our seedlings are shit currently, Social? Yes once a month I won?t be driving up the coast so can spend that time at the beach with kids. Q3-Will it improve the weak link? Hmmm I think my understanding of this question is limited. Maybe the chain of production link from Resource Conversion ( seed, soil, water, time) to Product Conversion ( weak link here being erratic germination, leggy seedlings that lack vitality) would be addressed??. Q4 Gross Profit Analysis- A.I?d have to do sums on materials. Q5.Energy source and use A. Once built it will be productive space for many years, the money we spend with our seedling supplier stays with her  and although we get that back from having good productivity we could save some. Buying from our seedling supplier is definitely addictive. Q6-Future indicators- I haven?t done these yet but if I ask the question will it move the needle then -Family- yes, more time for weekend. Community-no. Education-We?ll learn to grow better seedlings? Lame. Career- We?ll be better all round gardeners for sure, more professional and efficient. Health-Not really. Finances- Yes. Leisure- At seedling pick up I meet a mate for breakfast or visit friends the night before and camp. Its hard to say if I?d do this without the pick up run. Spirituality- not sure. Q7- Gut check- It would be an achievement worth celebrating if we could grow good seedlings.        How?d I go?</div></div></div><br/>

Your QoL might say something more general like ?we are relaxed and happy? and a Future Indicator of that might be ?we go surfing every week?. 

Does this make more sense?</div></div></div><br/>

If, however, you are saying something more general like, ?we are relaxed and happy?? you may find, through the testing framework, that there are many ways beyond just surfing every week to obtain and maintain that QoL. Surfing may become one of many things you do on a regular basis to stay relaxed and happy (or ?energized and refreshed? or whatever words seem to align with what surfing DOES for you). 

To get to the root of it, you could use the 5 - 7 whys.

I really connect with the "accept reality so we can take action" part too. Agree with @jkbernak on pruning ruthlessly wherever possible and constantly looking for overlaps.  One way to do this can be to look at prioritizing -- if ONE of those aspects in each section was most important, which would it be? Are you making any assumptions, e.g. "If we have surplus income..." sounds like you don't expect that to be a regular reality. What if it was? What if instead you combined a couple statements to "We direct a portion of our surplus income towards good causes and building local economy"? Finally... I like how you've partitioned "We are Good People" and "We are Good Farmers" and defined those specifically for each way in which you want to be. Beautiful work.</div></div></div><br/>

I too like that you've used an analog hand-writing process in the first step of visioning -- it really works a different part of the brain and keeps you away from the "bad idea LiteBrite" that is a screen (thx to @jkbernak for that one). One comment on your spreadsheet text is that there are a few aspects in which you've made decisions that you haven't tested yet, e.g. how often you finish a book, exercise, etc. These things may change -- designing in "time and peace of mind to finish a book" or "time to exercise regularly and keep my body fit" are ways to 'get generally specific' without trapping yourself into decisions made and constrictions imposed under dynamic circumstances... Otherwise, love the clarity and flowchart-like layout. And this: "I don't shit in drinking water unless I have to." Amen! (PS see also @theron 's comments on this specifics and not making decisions within the HC before they've been tested)</div></div></div><br/>

Also @regrarians -- once you start to apply the testing questions to your daily life, it really becomes instantaneous and much easier, without having to chart it out, particularly for smaller decisions.

Do you stop and focus on this challange 100% or you address it as much as possible and still try to build the whole context?" 1:27:15 @jkbernak @regrarians The whole of the holistic context is more important than the individual elements -- so if it's not working, move on. Get the big picture. There will always be uncertainty and areas of difficulty to specify. It generally takes ~3-5 years to get good clarity... going from getting the HC information, going back to old patterns, going back to the HC, revising, ... The point at which it becomes more important to you than anything else is when it really starts to work. Make quick passes, get the big picture, and go back.</div></div></div><br/>

I'm not good at tending plants. I've said it. There it is. Plants die in my care. So I've build the 'muscle' of self watering plantings and selecting drought loving plants. Example I picked up 46 spilanthes (amazing medicial herb for immune and mouth disease) from a friend was stoked about them, brought them home and forgot to water them. Was reminded by my partner about them, took in the shock that they'd crisped in the sun and then planted them by the pond vs the garden as it's wet there and the deer will only nibble them once. I try not to argue with reality. Katie goes on to speak about "We only suffer when we argue with reality but only 100% of the time." Ecology is dying across the world. Do I feel grief about it? Yes. Do I work within the spheres of influence I have? Yes? Do I labour over the ecology I can't change? Not any more. I feel the grief but not the shame/guilt/responsibility as, and this is important, I am not responsible for all things. And unless you or I took on a god like level of power in the last few days we will not be responsible. The tools of sovereignty I teach to clients help them to understand what's their business and what is not. Cheers - Javan</div></div></div><br/>

Regarding your "??" on Spiritual, keep in mind this doesn't have to be woo-woo... just a sense of connection with yourselves and your landscape is what it amounts to for many. Peace of mind, calm, etc. Looks like you've got a solid foundation with 28 CSA members -- and the best new sale comes from an old/existing customer. In the "wide range of skills" amongst the community and farm members, I wonder how many skills may remain to be tapped to create more income streams. I was just reading Luke Callahan's Guide to Growing Microgreens - may be something worth exploring and putting through your testing decisions; or something similar to stack additional products or functionality into your CSA program. Where are the gaps/weak links with Neighbours &amp; Community (a "3" on your wheel), what are the shortcomings in Health of Living Capital, and what would you do today to move these forward one 'notch' on the wheel? Would more gatherings for connections between community &amp; CSA members help move more products (or sell higher-value products) / improve financial areas while also improving community and neighbourhood? Sounds like the skillsets are there in managing diversity and integrating different people, as well as 'growing the things' grunt work.  Putting some of these pieces together and capitalizing on specific skills &amp; desires may create opportunities you hadn't seen before. Just immediate thoughts and points to ponder.</div></div></div><br/>

Beginning a couple of weeks ago, basically at the start of the course, some things in my personal life started to really unravel for me. I was having my own "earthquake", as @morad shared elsewhere was experiencing. Through @jkbernak presentations and personal reflections, and listening to a lot of Brené Brown talks, I really started to just focus on what my behaviors were that helped create this earthquake (because after all I really only have control over myself). It's been really helpful for me to think about what my weakest link has been. I'm choosing to focus my HC right now on managing my personal life and not overwhelm myself with tackling my job, or marriage, or whatever else, but really come home to self-care and my "Zone 00." What I've come to is that I've developed fairly destructive coping behaviors with how I've been handling stress over the years, things that have helped me numb it out and escape reality for a bit. Unfortunately it led me to feeling pretty depressed about a lot of things in my life and limited my ability to develop close relationships. So, my DaSOP/daily mantra right now is, "Life is perfect just as it is." It's brought a lot of clarity and helps me handle anxiety and stressors as they come up, and breathe through them, as well as bring my focus back towards gratitude for just being alive right now. Its also helping me focus more on the present, work on letting go of past resentments, and not feel shameful about myself for making the choices I did. It's been nice reading through people's statements and process with this and I'm really grateful for @regrarians to prioritize this part of the process and give it the time/space it deserves. I feel like it's helping me hit the restart/refresh button on my life. </div></div></div><br/>

The Keyline Scale of Permanence (KSOP) and Holistic Management (HM) were sitting there in front of me for the better part of 15 years before I saw their value in our scheme of things. 

Similarly I've been designing trainings around the Regrarians Platform (after the KSOP) since 2010 and developed 'Our Works Pattern' (OWP) in 1996-7 ? it wasn't until developing this REX program that I saw it value as something to follow in a training...

I wonder what we've also missed or overlooked in terms of processes and methodologies ? to be revealed no doubt!</div></div></div><br/>

I really like how I?m able to continue to get feedback on something that was covered 2 weeks ago, or keep returning to conversations as things continue to evolve, rather than have to move on because of time constraints.</div></div></div><br/>

I enjoy simplicity in the context and you've nailed that from a aesthetic perspective. Now for my detail slightly OCD brain's constructive critique. Excellent DeSOP. DaSOP, be more specific. Is working on what matters truly the weakest link in the whole? If so what specifically? Are the decision makers listed all primary? A split of primary and secondary? My major comment is there are loads of decisions, techniques and actually STUFF in your Forms of Production. Its' one of the reasons I moved away from that title as it conjures the THINGS vs that BEHAVIOURS and SYSTEMS necessary. For your first QOL the first three FOP are stellar. Then you get into decisions. Both of which are already outlined by the first three FOP. I'd take them out. The second QOL is almost all decisions. Take two or three steps back from 'mediation dome' what's the behaviours or system that's embodied within the mediation dome that you would seek to fulfill if the dome wasn't present? By removing tangible items and goals we improve the anti-fragility of our context from being dependant on one decisions and thus the mental state of the decision makers resting on if or if not the mediation dome and access to it exists (this is an extreme examples but I hope you connect this to placing QOL over GOALS). The rest of the QOLs are similar and I would be specific in your review and pruning. For the Future Resource base, there's some elements that are excellent and again some very specific decisions. Consider "energy is locally sourced and replenish-able" over cooking with fire. I imagine if you found a love of solar cooking this wouldn't be out of the question? Excellent work.</div></div></div><br/>

I love the integration &amp; colour coding of your QoL statements, Behaviours &amp; Systems, and Future Indicators. I haven't taken a look at supporting docs yet but will do. My only question on this one would be to comb through and really ask yourselves about some of the specifics you've detailed, e.g. "We produce gross profit statements for each enterprise and a P &amp; L for the Whole on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis," and taking 2-3 mths off per year. What if you could get a good overview of your GPA just doing the analyses quarterly? Are there other indicators that might reflect those numbers/profitability without that depth of analysis each month/quarter? And if your profitability analyses are top-notch, does that adequately reflect how the enterprise is doing? A bull's eye/Wheel of Life style qualitative assessment might be a more intuitive regular way of keeping an assessment, for instance, and then full profit &amp; loss, etc. analyses at certain junctures of the year, e.g. end of each season. Is 2-3 mths/year the goal or is to feel you have sufficient time &amp; freedom to travel where you want to while maintaining a viable farm operation? As @jkbernak mentioned a few weeks ago... take it to the field. Get it out of the laboratory and really test it against your daily lived reality. But you've definitely put a lot of work into clarifying &amp; keeping it concise &amp; workable for your farm. Nice job.</div></div></div><br/>
